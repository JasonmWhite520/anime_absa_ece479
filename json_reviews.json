The fights are well animated and entertaining, the attacks and moves get more and more ridiculous as episodes go by, and characters, although plain, are likeable and well designed. Don't hype this show because this is not the best show of the year, but it is definitively one of the most entertaining and fun to watch."

Put is simply, Keijo!!!!!!!! is The Colbert Report of anime."

Has good elements of shounen and comedy, the team battles were my favorite part and it was a joy to watch all the special techniques. I do not think the comedy would be right for everyone though and of all the genres, I think comedy is the most subjective. If you like toilet humor, this is a great series"

Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, but watch it sped up 2x so you don't feel like you're spending 5 hours watching a sports anime about anime girls bumping asses and tits."

I went into it like that, and soon found that it's more of a perverted action comedy than a slice of life sports anime. Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and I don't think you'll find one quiet like it. Thank you."
