    Death Note is original, awesome, and a great anime to watch. The only reason it isn't perfect is because of Near who has to be the lamest enemy ever. Also, the ending was a total cop-out. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.
    
    The art wasn't that great, but I sure did like this anime anyway.
    
    The sound was fitting; it suited the tense atmosphere and scenes.
    
    The characters were all intriguing and deep, especially Light. It's cool to see such an evil protagonist in an anime. He's certainly original.
    
    If you want a super-cool anime to watch, watch Death Note. Except for L and Near, who made everything totally unfabulous.
