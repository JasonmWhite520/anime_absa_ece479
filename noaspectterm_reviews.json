    "\n                Devil May Cry: The Animated Series: Is it Worth It or Worst?\n\r\nA Devil May Cry Game into an Anime? Really? H-How? H-How did you make this game into an anime. I-I-- (sigh)... Alright... Just, let me review this anime...\n\r\nDevil May Cry: The Animated Series... Is by far, THE WORST ANIME THAT I'VE WATCHED IN MY LIFE... FROM MADHOUSE ENTERTAINMENT?! REALLY? THE ONE WHO GAVES US DEATH NOTE, AND KISEIJUU COMES WITH THIS HORRIFYING PIECE OF S... Ahh... Fuu-- (sigh) okay... Okay... Settle down, Vaas... Just... Let me... Just me relax and focus on my review... Okay (Inhaling) (Exhaling)...\n\r\nAlright, let me review this, I was so\n                  \n\nshocked when my beloved video game franchise, Devil May Cry, became an anime. And, the most shockingly thing that I've been seen when I watch this English dub is that, it was came from MadHouse Entertainment! I mean, come on... At first I was like, \"Hmm... MadHouse? What more could I ask for? It was like, the best anime corporations out there, there's nothing hideous when I watch this anime, right? Devil May Cry: The Animated Series is going to be a BLAST.\" And then, when I watch it from first to the last, I-- I don't know... I don't freaking know what am I going to say to both CAPCOM (the gaming developers of Devil May Cry) and MadHouse about this... this... SELLOUT ANIME BASED FROM THE VIDEO GAME CRAP...\n\r\nI hate this adaptations, and this is main example why the adaptation is so cruel, is so vile and worst.\n\r\nStory:\r\nOkay, let's start with the Storyline shall we? (SPOILER ALERT) So it goes like this, there was man named Dante and a girl named Patty who stays in the Devil May Cry shop to search for her missing mother. Then, it also explains how Lady and Trish met (and that's why Trish and Lady became friends in the game; Devil May Cry 4), and wanted to kill all those who were in Dante's way, especially Sid, the main antagonist of the story who looks like a beggar at first but now he's a demon jackass. Oh, and by the way, this anime is CANON, meaning this anime is also set on the same universe on the game itself. So... As I checked on the storyline, it's just plain and simple, and also, there are no memorable things here in this anime, besides how Lady and Trish met, how Dante spoke profanity (which is kinda weird though), and Baul and Modeous' Appearances as Sparda's Protegees.\n\r\nBut you know what is worst in this anime? A Lot actually, like those Demon Fights with Dante which you think you'd expected longer and hardcore, well, I'd say, NOPE, it's not fun and I'd rather watch \"Shingeki No Kyojin\", \"Naruto\", or even the longest fight between Goku and Cell in \"Dragon Ball Z\" than wasting my time on this climatic... or should I say \"Boring\" Climatic Sequence. And also, really? On the episode where it sets on the Opera House, when Dante says to Patty \"Sorry kid, but this following sequence is FOR ADULTS ONLY.\" You also showed her any kinds of fighting and gore against those demons you've been facing with even the fight is sets behind the curtain... Really? Dante from the Anime World, a word of advice, Instead of telling her that, why don't you tell her to get out of the opera house because it's \"...FOR ADULTS ONLY\"... Really, Dante? Is this is how you treat that kid like that? \"Dante's Has No Son or Daughter Maybe That Was Acceptable, right?\" F--- NO!! He already looks like older now and a little mature, maybe he knows what is Good Values and Right Conduct. What is he? A Half-Demon, Half-Human with No Brain?\n\r\nArt:\r\nNope... I don't like it... Why? Because Dante, from my view, is kinda thin, what is he? Is he taking some dope or something? What's wrong with him? The Only Dante I Know is he has a Good Shape and With A Nice F-----G Abs #NoHomo... WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT IN THE ANIME?! And also, Lady is so Hideous... Much worst to Dante's look in DmC: Devil May Cry game. So, when my boner was about to engage, instead, my boner retreats... Trish... I don't know, but for me, she looks fine though so I accept that...\n\r\nAnd as for the other minor characters... I have no problems at all... Besides, they're just another bunch of anime characters from the DMC universe. Except they're new and not on the game. Because if they are existed in the game, I would just flipped myself over because of those hideous looks starting from Lady to Dante...\n\r\nSound:\r\nError 404: Best Sound or Soundtrack Not Found...\n\r\nCharacter:\r\nDante, speaks profanity, which is UNACCEPTABLE, but maintains its cool just like in the game. Lady, has the worst shape but her character maintains it, and Trish, which is also acceptable. Appearantly, those characters are just good enough... Except Sid, I don't like his face. PERIOD. Maybe next time, try Ver--... No... No... Not here in this anime... Oh how about this... NEXT TIME... TRY MAKING A ANTAGONIST THAT LOOKS LIKE VERGIL AND FIGHTS LIKE VERGIL EXCEPT IT'S A DIFFERENT NAME, how about that?\n\r\nEnjoyment:\r\nFun Part of the story? I'd say... Hmm... Wait... Give me more minutes to think...\r\n(More Minutes Later)\r\n...\r\n...\r\nNope, I don't enjoy it... Oh wait... There's One... That was closing my Windows Media Player which contain the Episodes from Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, shutting down my PC, and go to sleep like it was just a dream... or a nightmare perhaps...\n\r\nOverall:\r\nIn my opinion... It's enough to play Devil May Cry games except watching this anime. I'm sorry, I don't like this and I wanted to have more time to watch any other animes besides this anime toilet... So, if you want to watch this anime, I RECOMMENDED YOU TO WATCH \"DEATH NOTE\" or \"PARASYTE -THE MAXIM-\". Two of the most well recommended anime shows from MadHouse Entertainment.\n\r\nParasyte -The Maxim- is maybe the best choice to devour Devil May Cry: The Animated Series onto it's roots. Why? Parasyte has the best battle out there and it has a great storyline with a well character development. So I recommend to watch that instead of this hideous anime adaptation based on the game.\n\r\nSo my final verdict is 3/10... It almost gone out to 2 or pathetic score. But because Dante's jokes that are kinda funny, and the explaination on how Lady and Trish turns out into good friends from DMC4, i guess that's enough to cover it...",
    "\n                Story - The overall story left me wanting a bit more depth. It is borderline slice-of-life action, A wired combination and it doesn't work all that well in my opinion. There seems to be no plot going on throughout the first few episodes however the plot slowly develops a very tiny bit per episode until it reaches its climax in episode 11/12. the overall story had me a little bored however the last few episodes were some of the best anime I have ever seen. They were tense on the edge action and it is a great reward for sticking through the slow storyline.\n\r\nArt -\n                  \n\nThe art is amazing. Defiantly something that should be admired. the art really adds to the level of depth and helps indulge the watcher in Dante's world.\n\r\nSound - Although a little repetitive at times the sound fits the anime quite well. The OP is amazing, It also has a very small role in the anime which really made me smile - I don't want to reveal too much but its usage in the last episode is amazing. The ED is almost engrish, the words change frequently which was a bit strange but the overall feel of the ED was a nice way to wind down after an action packed anime.\n\r\nEnjoyment - I didn't enjoy quite a few of the episodes however the last two episodes really redeemed the show. There are ups and downs and, as I have said before, everything comes together in the last few episodes.\n\r\nOverall - Overall I liked this anime, the last episodes are amazing whilst the middle episodes (3-9) are quite boring however worth watching to see the very high tension ending.",

    "\n                Story - The overall story left me wanting a bit more depth. It is borderline slice-of-life action, A wired combination and it doesn't work all that well in my opinion. There seems to be no plot going on throughout the first few episodes however the plot slowly develops a very tiny bit per episode until it reaches its climax in episode 11/12. the overall story had me a little bored however the last few episodes were some of the best anime I have ever seen. They were tense on the edge action and it is a great reward for sticking through the slow storyline.\n\r\nArt -\n                  \n\nThe art is amazing. Defiantly something that should be admired. the art really adds to the level of depth and helps indulge the watcher in Dante's world.\n\r\nSound - Although a little repetitive at times the sound fits the anime quite well. The OP is amazing, It also has a very small role in the anime which really made me smile - I don't want to reveal too much but its usage in the last episode is amazing. The ED is almost engrish, the words change frequently which was a bit strange but the overall feel of the ED was a nice way to wind down after an action packed anime.\n\r\nEnjoyment - I didn't enjoy quite a few of the episodes however the last two episodes really redeemed the show. There are ups and downs and, as I have said before, everything comes together in the last few episodes.\n\r\nOverall - Overall I liked this anime, the last episodes are amazing whilst the middle episodes (3-9) are quite boring however worth watching to see the very high tension ending."
