    "attention to the plot anymore (\"I'm talking about boobs\"). The animation is top notch and the voice acting is decent as well (I watched the dub). If your thinking about watching this anime, one thing to keep in mind is, don't take it seriously. The butt-fighting moves are unrealistic (in a good way). I went into it like that, and soon found that it's more of a perverted action comedy than a slice of life sports anime. Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and I don't think you'll find one quiet like it. Thank you."
