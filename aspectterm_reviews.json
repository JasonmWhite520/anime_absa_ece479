    "\n                -------------------------------------\r\n Naruto Shippuden : Review |\r\n-------------------------------------\n\r\nNaruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. \n\r\nLet me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has\n                  \n\nbeen the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular while also explaining its flaws.\n\r\n-----------\r\nStory - 8\r\n-----------\n\r\nThe story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below.\n\r\nLet's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.\r\nThe issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don\u2019t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. \r\nHowever, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is,\n\r\nPacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.\n\r\nNow that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.\r\nThe main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. \r\nAnother thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.\n\r\nThe amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious.\n\r\nSomething that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments.\n\r\nBeing a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.\r\nAs I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. \r\nVariety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!\n\r\nThe last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves.\n\r\nThroughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.\n\r\n--------------------\r\nCharacters - 10\r\n--------------------\n\r\nNow this is the core of the franchise. \r\nEach character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.\r\nNo matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. \r\nYou will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.\n\r\nNow let's move on to the \"Villains\" \r\nThis series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.\r\n*Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the \"heroes.\" The morality here is blurred.\n\r\nBut coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nArt and Animation - 7.5\r\n-----------------------------\n\r\nAgain we have a mixed bag here. \r\nThis show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.\r\nI think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita\u2019s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! \r\nDespite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.\n\r\nAnd as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.\n\r\n--------------\r\nSound - 10\r\n--------------\n\r\nThis is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 10\r\n------------------------------------------------\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself.\r\nAnd with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.\n\r\nSub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n| Recommendations for Similar Series |\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n\r\n[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.\n\r\n[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. \n\r\n[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden.\n\r\n[Proofreading - SomeRandomNerd]",
    "\n                After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. \n\r\nNow I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series.\n\r\nStory: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. I\n                  \n\ncouldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me.\n\r\nCharacters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10\n\r\nArt / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10\n\r\nSound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10\n\r\nOk, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? \n\r\nPacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing!\n\r\nArguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. \n\r\nOverall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",
    "\n                I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. \n\r\nFirst of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage,\n                  \n\nbeing clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. \n\r\nI loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. \n\r\nAkatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10)\n\r\nOf course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) \n\r\nTo be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) \n\r\nIn Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development.  (10/10)\n\r\nSo, to justify and defend Shippuuden... \r\nFirst of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. \n\r\nNaruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",
    "\n                First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end.  Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone.  This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that.  This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? \n\r\nI'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true.  At times the fillers can be\n                  \n\nfunny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line.  There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times.  The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great.  But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around)\n\r\nI don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer.  I'll start off with the characters.  The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters.  I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds.  The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was.  At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line.  The plot was pretty interesting, but very long.  While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up.  Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important.  The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together.  I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that.  Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well.  In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show.  It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases.  I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons.\n\r\n I highly recommend watching this whole anime.  Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end.  While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels.  The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions.  This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",
    "\n                  Oh, I hope that I\u2019ll be the first to write the review when all the Naruto anime series end. Well, what should I start with\u2026 15 years. For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it \u2026 it\u2019s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! \n\r\n  The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Though\n                  \n\nthe journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand \u2013 this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years \u2013 the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now \u2013 a husband\u2026 ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation.\n\r\n  Now let\u2019s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. \n\r\n  I\u2019ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind \u2013 Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible.\n\r\n  Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they\u2019ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows\u2019 drawing it does not make the original run look worse.\n\r\n  Unlike art styling \u2013 music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos\u2019 OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero\u2019s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains\u2019 theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer \u2013 Yasuharu Takanashi.\n\r\n  The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they\u2019ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that \u2013 they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. \n\r\n  The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that\u2019s because I felt much the same as the main hero and \u2018ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human\u2019s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them \u2013 it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is.\n\r\n  Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years.  I personally bow to all of you and say: \u201cThank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!\u201d And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.",
    "\n                Let me just clarify this now while we\u2019re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I\u2019ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you\u2019d care to know why, or you\u2019re simply curious, read on. \n\r\nStory: 10/10\n\r\nI personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it may\n                  \n\nnot be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. \n\r\nIn the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn\u2019t just some \u2018demon-fox child\u2019, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it\u2019s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that.\n\r\nEverything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself.\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\n\r\nSimple. I\u2019ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it\u2019s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it\u2019s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters\u2019 faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real.\n\r\nAlso, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, \u2018We saw that scene literally an episode ago!\u2019, and honestly, it\u2019s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we\u2019ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it\u2019s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. \n\r\nSound: 8/10\n\r\nThe openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great!\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\n\r\nCharacter; also translated to the sum of ones\u2019 personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it\u2019s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now.  We see how the \u2018heroes\u2019 have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be.  The \u2018villains\u2019, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they\u2019re not only \u2018evil\u2019 simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that\u2019s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn\u2019t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that\u2019s, honestly, great.\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\n\r\nShippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that\u2019s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn\u2019t have become so popular if it wasn\u2019t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn\u2019t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don\u2019t watch them. Simple. An animes\u2019 worth isn\u2019t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it\u2019s amazing. So if you haven\u2019t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.",
    "\n                Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so.\n\r\nThe story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always fun\n                  \n\nto watch\n\r\nBut - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing.\n\r\n&quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know.\n\r\nThe animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it).\n\r\nThe soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. \n\r\nAs of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development.\n\r\nSo far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now.\n\r\nEDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8  \n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entire\n                  \n\nanime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it\u2019s worst, trashy nineties OVA.\n\r\nShippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show.\n\r\nOne good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves.\n\r\nNaruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I\u2019ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto\u2019s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs.\n\r\nIt also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you  respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. \n\r\nNow, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of \"meh\", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. \n\r\nThe worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it.\n\r\nAnd this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole!\n\r\nThese final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can\u2019t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I\u2019m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it\u2019s not enough to save the whole series. The \u201cfinal\u201d villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy.  Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen.\n\r\nI could go on and on about every little thing, but I\u2019ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I\u2019ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.",
    "\n                First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto.\n\r\nNaruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the first\n                  \n\nseries.\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be.\n\r\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\r\nI know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life.\n\r\nArt: 9 (Great)\r\nI didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score.\r\nI think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9.\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Outstanding)\r\nI've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\r\nI had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it.\r\nIt has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate.\n\r\nOverall: 10 (Outstanding)\r\nOverall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. \n\r\nOn a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",
    "\n                TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]\n\r\nBelieve it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest\u2026 or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in this\n                  \n\nsuper long show?  \n\r\nRage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. \n\r\nIf you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! \n\r\nIf the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. \n\r\nOverall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it!\n\r\nP.S.

    "\n                It's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the  fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked.\n\r\nStory:\n\r\nAh, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obito and Madara were those two. The later of the War\n                  \n\nArc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved.\n\r\nArt:\n\r\nSadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said.\n\r\nSound:\n\r\nNaruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime.\n\r\nCharacter:\n\r\nNaruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about  today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the \"muh sakura is useless\", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry.\n\r\nEnjoyment:\n\r\nWow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. \n\r\nOverall:\n\r\nI enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed.  Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, \"wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end\" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.",
    "\n                I cannot believe this poor excuse of a directing team gets a near 8 overall, and MANY 9's/10's for their work. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a \"6\" constitutes \"Fair\". Meaning, this anime is better than \"Mediocre\", better than \"Decent\".\n\r\n(the mean of the subcategory values doesn't equal 6 because MAL lacks a \"flow\" category)\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is probably the most famous anime to the general American populous. You might consider that one guy the whitest guy on the planet, yet he's probably watched some form of anime: Naruto. In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that can\n                  \n\nrelate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being \"overrated\", and that is exactly what I believe it to be.\n\r\nThe story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of \"ninja battles\" vs \"demon battles\". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama.\n\r\nIndeed, this anime capitalizes on \"Talk no Jutsu\" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; \"oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog\". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes.\n\r\nOverall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of \"overpowered\" ninjas along with all the \"demon\" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",
    "\n                At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season.\n\r\nWhat started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun.\n\r\nWe are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bits\n                  \n\nand pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun!\n\r\nI don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun.\n\r\nThe art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun!\n\r\nNaruto is also no longer funny.\n\r\nWell, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch.\n\r\nAlthough I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably.\n\r\nAnother %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke. Can you believe it?",
    "\n                Love gives birth to sacrifice.\n\r\nIt's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one.\n\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with the\n                  \n\nplot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper.\n\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nIt's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now.\n\r\nSound: 9/10\r\nI loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes.\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\r\nThis anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. \r\nNaruto: Immature, hard headed,  strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him.\r\nSasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read;  you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if  you were completely off base.\r\nSakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful.\r\nKakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was.\r\nPain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly.\r\nThere are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\r\nMy overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime..\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\r\nMy overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. \n\r\n*I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime. But anyway please feel free to write on my profile, I want feedback!",
    "\n                   This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say.\n\r\n   I'll begin with my view on the story line.\n                  \n\nI had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those \"Yeah, I get it\" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate.\n\r\n   I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those \"Yeah, I get it\" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^\n\r\n   Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest.\n\r\n   Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer.\n\r\n   Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",
    "\n                227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion.\n\r\nNaruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad.\n\r\nNow we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple.\n\r\nThis series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed by\n                  \n\nthis DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger.\n\r\nOthers may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it.\n\r\nFillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like.\n\r\nThe story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their \"forbidden\" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing.\n\r\nSome people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said \"gay\". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper.\n\r\nThis is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.\n\r\nHow you found this review even remotely helpful.\n\r\nFeedback greatly appreciated XD",
    "\n                In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact an\n                  \n\nextremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games.  He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their \"ninja way\", be it peace or revenge, etc.\n\r\nThis anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. \n\r\nTaking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just  \"this or that\". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do.\n\r\n(I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put \"about 3 years later.\" I know anime fans can be very picky about your \"facts\". :d)",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden is the new Dragonball Z. Remember back in the day where it took like 6 episodes to finish something that should only take 5 minutes? Yeah... Naruto is turning into that. \n\r\nOne of the biggest problems about the show is not necessarily the flashbacks (hey think of it as a supplement to the manga), but instead, the recaps. Recycling footage may have worked in the late 80's/90's, but this is ridiculous. You can tell that they're really just trying to prevent the show from going past the manga which, based on past experiences, is a good idea. However, fillers are better if some\n                  \n\neffort is put into them (unlike the fillers from the original Naruto). \n\r\nOther than this complaint, the sequel series has been a great improvement from the original series. The animation was superb and the music fits well into the scenes. The characters are well drawn, and it's great to see the battle scenes drawn well (I still cringe at the thought of what happened to some of the battle animations back in the original). The music, well, I'll admit that some of the ops have been really annoying, but I was instantly hooked with &quot;Hero's Come Back&quot;.  Furthermore, it's great to see some better insight of some of the characters (which means, yes, I do appreciate some of the flashbacks). However, my biggest complaint about the show's character development is the fear that the script writers will revert back to the cookie cutter characters that they made in the past show, which just made things dull. I understand that a lot of the characters have a sad past, but please, cut down on the melodrama sometimes eh? The show is going to turn into a drama at the projected rate that we saw in the last filler arc. Other than that though, it's finally nice to see some villains that I don't hate with a passion though (I'm sick of seeing Orochimaru's &quot;I can't die&quot; routine). Anyways, here's my breakdown:\n\r\nStory: (10/10) Hey, the core story is very great, simple and yet it involve so many different characters.\n\r\nCharacters: (9/10) Gotta admit, the characters are well done. It is great to finally see a better development of the old characters, and also, it's great to see the new characters be unique in their own way (how do you not like Sai's lack of common sense?).\r\nHowever, I'm sick of this &quot;you have no idea how hard my life was&quot; crap from some em...\r\nspecially the last filler character, it's a bad reminder of the cookie cutter side protagonists that they made from the original Naruto in the fillers. However, other than that, \n\r\nAnimation: (9/10) I think one of the strong points of this show was definitely the animation. Everything that was shown was very fluid which made the show very mesmerizing to watch. I gotta admit, one of the highlights that I found watching this show was watching everyone use their own specialty set of moves.\n\r\nMusic: (9/10) Ok, I liked the music, it is so great and has it always make me so emotional.\n\r\nFinal comments: Naruto Shippuuden is the ultimate anime out there for me. I will keep watching it week by week till the last episode (unless there are fillers involved)^_^!!",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden\n\r\nStory(9)\r\nWell, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2,\n                  \n\nmaybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days.\n\r\nArt(9)\r\nThe art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel.\n\r\nSound(9)\r\nThere are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too. \n\r\nCharacter(9)\r\nAs I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well.\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)\r\nNaruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch.\n\r\nOverall(9)\r\nWell, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P",
    "\n                Yes, I'm writing a Shippuuden review. Why? I really don't know myself. Well screw that, lets get into the review.\n\r\nI read most of the other reviews to get an idea of what others are saying so I don't add to the pile of redundancy, and I see that many people have &quot;tried to love Shippuuden&quot;. After watching Naruto when I was 13 and loving it, I watched other animes and realized that Naruto was far inferior to most other quality animes. Yet, because I loved Naruto so much back then (It was my first anime), the thought of an amped-up, older, maturer, badass-er Naruto tickled\n                  \n\nmy anime tooth (or something like that).\n\r\nThe first thing that excited me about Shippuuden was &quot;YES! THE FILLERS ARE OVER! Now we can have some actual plot movement!&quot; The unfortunate truth: You're not gonna be getting any of that soon...\r\nNaruto Shippuuden feels like it could be going twice as fast, wasting half as much time, and developing characters like no tomorrow. Maybe no one has any ideas about what happens after the Sasuke issue is settled, so they're stalling. It certainly feels like that, and as the episodes drag on, I feel like im drifting farther from understanding the characters, who could be wonderfully developed.\n\r\nI had set my standards high for the new Naruto, but the only thing that happened in the years that I waited was I got older, the characters got older, the plotline got moldier, the fillers got bolder, and the enjoyment got colder. It feels like even sub-main plotlines are becoming fillers, which is a shame. Naruto has such potential because of its diversity and huge fanbase, but the sad truth is that shippuuden is not much different from the old naruto.\n\r\nNow that all the bad stuff is out of the way, the anime is not horrible. Its still a good anime, there's just not that special shine that you find in that anime that you usually weren't expecting. Naruto has an unbelievable amount of hype for younger kids, so if you're looking for something more mature, turn away. If you're a young viewer that just started on anime (who I doubt would be reading this, but nonetheless...) look no further than naruto. Again, its not a bad anime, its just slow, and you have to be patient. Unfortunately, that is one thing that I lack while watching anime.",
    "\n                I don't know where to start, this show is outstanding. People have an annoying habit of talking down all the popular anime, and in some cases, popular anime does not deserve all the fame. But here I cant think of anything to talk down on! (Besides fillers of course.)\n\r\nBut anyway, Naruto Shippuden has many strong points, characters, story, music, I cant think of an any elements to this anime that have dissatisfied me. It has a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Its still there although the comedy starts to fade off a bit in Shippuden, but thats because so much is going on!\n\r\nThe characters,\n                  \n\nare very easy to become attached too. The Shinobi world is full of great people, each with their own quirk or trait to better the series. The most rewarding aspect of Naruto is probably the way all of the characters, especially Naruto, grow. Coming back from the time skip from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden, you really see the characters change. Even from early Shippuden to current Shippuden, Naruto and all his friends have evolved into outstanding ninja. It really motivates me, when I see Naruto accomplish near impossible feats, when he started as such a knucklehead. My favorite thing about Naruto is that he changes all the people he meets. The author gave his character a unique way with words that makes him even more interesting! The villains, truly project the evils of the ninja world. If there's a bad character, he's bad. They have you fearing them even though they're not real. They always seem invincible, which is the scariest part.\n\r\nThe plot is great. There are so many things about this show that have went unanswered for so long, and the writer does such a great job of tying them all together! The plot progresses smoothly and quickly, the episodes are 23 min, but feel like 5. The twists are unforeseeable, and catch you off guard, yet at a certain degree, are slightly predictable. The foreshadowing is great. Something is said, than 100 episodes later something happens and you immediately think of the quote 100 episodes earlier. There are also so many powerful moments. I'll admit in a lot of the heart warming scenes I've cried. The best part is there's tears of joy and tears of sadness. The story really causes you to feel for the characters. The emotional/moral lessons you can get out of this are stronger than ANY anime I've seen. The fight scenes, 10/10. Each one conveys a unique message about life itself, and they are all powerful.They were all quite motivating imo. The theme of hatred runs throughout the story, and you see the clear differences of those who choose the path of hate, and those who don't. \n\r\nIt also has great re-watching value, partly because you see all the foreshadowing. There are so many episodes, and a great number of them were memorable.\n\r\nSoundtrack was great, I loved the openings and endings. It was a pleasure to listen to them before and after each episode. \n\r\nIf there's any advice I have for this show, don't go through it too fast. The show has somewhat delayed gratification. It's hella good when you take it slow. You can't rush straight into it. I'm going to be honest, it's probably way better to people who watched Naruto as kids, because they grew up, with him. They watched him grow and mature just as they did themselves, so it's extra special. But nonetheless, Naruto Shippuden is a great ride, and anyone can love it. I'd reccomend it to anyone whose already watched the original naruto series.It really is worth the time.",
    "\n                I was a little late to the Naruto party, i started watching the anime 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. \n\r\nAs many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. \n\r\nPutting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was very\n                  \n\nnice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it.\n\r\nOverall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",
    "\n                Back in high school, I was an avid Naruto fan. I discovered the series when I was 14 years old and binged it all in 2 weeks, and started Shippuuden soon after.  I loved it at first, and revered it during the Pain arc, but soon after I found the show started to decline in quality. And now looking back, I find the show had pretty serious problems throughout its run.\n\r\nJust to get this out of the way, the egregious amounts of filler amidst very few canon episodes as well as a lot of episodes consisting of 70% flashbacks and 30% actual content is\n                  \n\nseriously off-putting. \n\r\nYes, I know Naruto spent his childhood alone on a swing-set; no, I don't have to see that scene for the billionth time. \n\r\nThese aspects became so unbearable that I (and many of my friends) ended up dropping the show halfway through the Great War arc and just read the manga chapters whenever they would come out. Doing this made me realize how poorly the pacing and execution of that last arc was handled, and when I eventually went back to catch up on what I missed, I wasn't surprised to find these errors hadn't been rectified at all.\n\n\r\nI think there's a common theme to be had in considering the series that is Shippuuden: inconsistency. In almost every aspect here, Naruto excels at some point in time and then fails to deliver otherwise. The series is definitely one of highs and lows, and I think the lows have overwhelmed whatever high points the series ever had.\n\n\r\nStory: 6/10. Our first look at the inconsistency of Shippuuden is targeted at how the various arcs vary in quality and immersion. I want to talk about what I consider the highest point and lowest point of the series: the Pain arc and the Great War arc (respectively).\n\r\nThe Pain arc was a beautifully told story focusing on themes of abandonment, true peace, war, perseverance and acceptance. We saw amazing character development in Naruto: from the loss of his mentor/friend/father-figure to his ability to finally surpass his limitations and become a great ninja, it seems this was what the whole show had been built up to. Furthermore, we had an amazing villain to complement Naruto: Pain. A rather intriguing villain who we can empathize with, Pain and his tragedy really helped build on the themes of the arc. He challenged Naruto, both in physical prowess and personal philosophy, and through it all Naruto was able to learn what he holds dear. All in all, a really great arc; not without its flaws, but still a great story well told. \n\r\nThen comes the Great War arc, which is 1) too drawn out, 2) ignores character development and replaces it with obscure power-ups, 3) ignores 99% of the interesting cast to focus only on characters with special eye powers and Naruto, 4) has too many villains, each one diluting the significance of the other. \n\r\nThis arc didn't need Kaguya. Obito and Madara were fine villains on their own, and whatever themes the arc wanted to handle could've been well done using only them. Once Kaguya is introduced, we go into the territory of power creep, bs powerups and no one being able to keep up with the villain unless 1) they're a main character like Naruto, 2) they have special eyes like Sasuke, or 3) they randomly get god powers (i.e. both Naruto and Sasuke). Chakra was such a great power system in the original Naruto that didn't model rather one-dimensional power systems, lie Ki in DBZ. It seems now that chakra unfortunately devolved into becoming glorified Ki.\n\r\nAs an aside, if you watched this arc while it was airing and stuck through it, I'm not sure how you did it. I watched this arc while I was an avid fan of Naruto and ignored every criticism of it, and even then I had to drop it for a time to read the manga before I could eventually get back to watching it. The filler; the flashbacks; the slow pacing: all of these put me off. When an episode is 15 minutes flashback and 5 minutes of actually story progression, the show loses sight of where it wants to go and just becomes something that beats already explored themes and concepts down your throat. \n\n\n\r\nArt: 5/10. Inconsistent once again. Some scenes are downright shoddily drawn and bland. I understand that long running shounen tend to have this problem, and we see it a lot in shows like DBSuper and One Piece, but it still holds that the art leaves something to be desired.\n\r\nThe show does have its moments with some pretty aesthetic character designs and well animated fights. The Pain fight is an example of pretty bad art at times, but amazing animation.\n\n\r\nSound: 9/10. The OST for Naruto is pretty freaking great. However, given that the show has around 20 openings and endings (maybe even more, I haven't counted), there have been a fair share of really bad and really good songs.\n\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10. After the Pain arc, we see character motivations start to morph into one-dimensional determinations or become outright forgotten. The biggest offender is the Great War arc, which takes away 99% of an interesting cast to focus solely on Naruto and Sasuke and their bs powerups. \n\r\nAlso, imo, Sasuke is probably the worst written character in the show. I don't want to get into an entire essay on why I think this (because trust me, I could), so I'll just list out some of my points for why I really despise him and the writing that surrounds him and his circumstances.\n\r\n1) The love relationship between him and Sakura makes no sense. They literally have no chemistry together.\r\n2) Itachi gives up his life to ensure his brother can live in peace, and Sasuke decides to start a war to honor him. Way to respect your brother's wishes. Alright buddy.\r\n3) Dude causes grief to literally every character in the show, then pops up like it's nobody's business during the war and lets it slide that he's going to become Hokage. I actually had to pause because I burst out laughing. Did he really think he'd be taken seriously? \r\n4) His overbearing arrogance borders on stupidity. He attacks a 5 kage summit, ignores advice from others and then cries about the arrogance of the leaders of the hidden leaf who put Itachi through pain. You're not any better, dude.\r\n5) My last point, his undeserved strength and the fact that his relevance to the plot hinges on that alone. Without his eyes, he would be NOTHING. Everything special about him comes from Kishimoto giving him powerup after powerup; atleast in Naruto he had to work for things like Chidori. Now, he can just fire off infinite Chidoris, summon black flames that never go out and eventually conjure up a gigantic Titan made of chakra to dispose of enemies. \n\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10. My enjoyment, as well, was inconsistent: it varied a lot while watching, from downright bored to immensely engaged. I consider the Pain arc the highest point of the series and one of the best arcs in shounen, and that arc alone deserves a 9/10 at the very least. But after that, I'm afraid the show went through a downward spiral and destroyed itself with the final arc.\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. \n\r\n+ Pain arc\r\n+ Everything up to the Pain arc is somewhat interesting\n\n\r\n- Show falls into a downward spiral after the Pain arc and crumbles during its final arc\r\n- The diverse and interesting cast is underused in the final arc\r\n- Chakra loses its nuance \r\n- Fights after Pain become a matter of who can stack on more god power + eye powers to win\r\n- Some sub-plots are entirely ignored and never answered in the show. \n\n\r\nIf you really want to watch Naruto, you might have a better time now that you can skip the filler, but the pacing still leaves something to be desired. At the very least the manga fixes the pacing problem somewhat, but I still find it fails to deliver in terms of story and characters. All in all, the show was a major disappointment.",
    "\n                \"I will bring Sauske back no matter what!\"\n\r\nThat quote pretty much sums up a lot of Naruto Shippudean and people who read this review if you haven't watched Naruto then I suggest you watch it because there are somethings you need to know before starting Naruto Shippudean because Naruto Shipudean contains spoliers if you haven't watched Naruto. \n\r\nNaruto Shippudean is a new story that revolves around Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno's adventures and their search for Sauske Uchiha after he defected from Konoha in order to gain Orchimaru' power. There are two new characters that join in Naruto Shippudean which is Yamato and Sai. The\n                  \n\nplot also involves the active Akatsuki in their quest to obtain all of the tailed beasts. \n\r\nThe art style of this anime is really different compared to the first episode of Naruto.  In Naruto it was kind of a little bit cartoony a little bit but it still looked like anime. In Naruto Shippudean the art style was newer and the effects were a lot better in Naruto Shippudean.\n\r\nThe Characters in the story there is a lot of them but I am going to focus on the main characters. Naruto has the Nine Tails inside of him. He ultimately gets stronger because He is so obessed with getting Sauske back so Sauske is getting him stronger and making him move further. Sakura Haruno is a girl from Team 7 or apart of Naruto\u2019s team. She has gotten stronger because she was trained by the 5th hokage Tsunade who is strong in the previous Naruto series she was obessed with Sauske and practically was in love with him but she was a weak character but now I see her getting stronger. Sauske Uchiha was a former Leaf Village Ninja who decided to wanted to gain more power so he joined Orchimaru and Orchimaru trained him a lot and how he got stronger is because of his hatred towards his brother Itachi and he wanted to kill him because of what Sauske think Itachi did. \n\r\nMy overall enjoyment for Naruto Shippudean is that it\u2019s a very good show and if you liked Naruto then I suggest you watch this show because Naruto gets a lot better and stronger. There are things that happen in the anime that will shock you or you didn\u2019t know about different characters but Naruto Shippudean has a lot of in depth fillers about some characters past and I won\u2019t spoil anything because that is for you to find out yourself. The show is still airing as of now and the way things are unfolding is pretty good. Overall if you liked Naruto I highly recommend Naruto Shippudean.",
    "\n                A continuation from the old Naruto. While only the first 2 episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \\'same old\\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement over\n                  \n\nthe first generation.\n\r\nIf you haven\\'t started watching the new season, don\\'t- read the manga instead.",
    "\n                TL;DR\r\n+ some OP and ED songs\r\n+ short-living cool moments\r\n- fillers and flashbacks\r\n- visuals, all of them\r\n- overused sound assets\r\n- pacing and episode direction\n\r\nStory\r\nStory continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable.\r\nStory in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is\n                  \n\nblinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination.\n\r\nArt\r\nAnimation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the \"characters move so fast\"... Right.\r\nBackground images could be split into 3 types - trees, village, cave. None of these are eye candies really.\n\r\nSound\r\nPersonally, more often than not I enjoyed opening and ending songs. What's worse though are background sounds. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible, but they were nice to listen to the first million times. They've become something like a trademark now and watching the episodes muted wouldn't wouldn't make any difference as you can easily guess what'll play.\r\nVoice acting has been ok at best. Naruto is still voiced by a lady.\n\r\nCharacter\r\nCharacters didn't change at all at start, except they grew bigger and stronger. A lot later there's some development going on, but only between 2 main characters. It's still very refreshing to see though.\r\nSo basically, Naruto is still gutsy dude who wants to be the very best and Sasuke is still darkness. That's about it.\n\r\nEnjoyment\r\nI enjoyed few nice battles or moments. Unfortunately, most of these were partially or completely destroyed by horrible pacing and animation. Most of the rest can be easily skipped.\n\r\nOverall\r\nStarted off as \"ok\", but for a long time now, this show has been a mass produced garbage made just to milk more money from fans. The only way an episode can keep my attention is if I triple the playback speed.\r\nI suggest you watch this ONLY if you haven't seen the previous season and stop as soon as you start getting bored, because trust me, it will only get worse. Whether we like it or not, Naruto is a big piece of anime history and it shold be experienced by all fans (at least a bit).",
    "\n                This Tv Anime Series is the most amazing one out there. Dont get me wrong i do agree with many people that there can be one to many fillers but that shouldnt sway your judgement of this amazing anime.\n\r\nStory: The story is just amazing it plays out great even if it has one or two fillers before they get to the real stuff the action ect. Everything fits and it is quick witted when it comes to connecting the dots.\n\r\nArt: What can i say? Its great art for anime imo. The fight scenes are nice and clean art as well overal put together well\n\r\nSound: I\n                  \n\nreally Think the sound overall is very good in this series it all fits and you dont find off beat rhythmes\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are amazing there arent many that dont play a full part in this series. \n\r\nEnjoyment: Really whats not to enjoy? This has all of it Action, Adventure, And its just great to see ninjas doing all sorts of amazing jutsu's it really is entertaning.\n\r\nOverall: Overall this is anime satisfys your every need. I really am astonished to see its rating i feel its VERY under rated and is a most see for all",
    "\n                Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. \n\r\nShippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite\n                  \n\nof the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. \n\r\nIt is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. \n\r\nWhile Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant. \n\r\nThis is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. \n\r\nThere are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation.\n\r\nIf you are a fan of anime's such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai 7, Pokemon. There is a massive possibility you will like it Shippuden. If you have watched the first series then you will adore it as in my opinion this sequel is even better.\n\r\nRegards\n\r\n-Kep0v",
    "\n                [Story]\n\r\nGreat story, won't put too much because I wouldn't want to spoil anything.\n\r\nThe story of Naruto Shippuden follows a few years after the events of the original series.\n\r\nNaruto, the main protagonist, is a ninja that everyone loves.  He is goofy, nice, not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but determined to help the people he cares about and gain the respect of the people in his village, never straying from his path to become the Hokage. (Hokage = Leader of the village)\n\r\nNaruto is a Jinchuuriki, or a person who has one of the nine mystical tailed beasts sealed inside of him.  This\n                  \n\noften caused him great grief and sorrow early on in his life because the villagers feared and hated him for what he was.  He occasionally has bouts with the nine-tailed beast inside of him, usually over control of his body and the use of it's evil power or chakra.\n\r\nIn Shippuden, a lot of the focus is geared towards the Akatsuki, an evil organisation with a plan (not revealing) and Naruto's childhood rival and \"friend\" Sasuke.\n\r\nI'm done typing about the story, so if you want more, watch the show and you'll quickly pick up what's going on.\n\r\n[Sound]\n\r\nA sound effect for everything, like there should be.\n\r\nThe ambient sounds and situational music haven't changed in forever+2.\n\r\nThey were good when the series started and that hasn't changed, I only give it a 7 for never ever ever ever changing.\n\r\n[Art]\n\r\nWell they don't change clothes, so they must either not sweat or have really great hygiene.\n\r\nI'm not one to judge art too harshly, but the angles are good and you can usually tell what's going on in a fight.\n\r\n[Character/Hate]\n\r\nMain characters:\n\r\nNaruto - Pretty much described in the [Story] section.\n\r\nSasuke - Emotional, tormented, get's exponentially stronger every time you see him.  Sasuke is Naruto's childhood rival and \"friend\" that Naruto is always trying to save.  Sasuke has a horribly tragic beginning in which his whole clan was slain by his brother who then taunts him to grow spiteful and strong to eventually come and get revenge on him.\n\r\nTobi (No spoiler) - A member of the Akatski with a plan. All I can say when putting the words \"no spoiler\" in it.\n\n\r\nWon't go on about the side characters, except for this following hate part:\n\r\nThe characters are great for the most part, except for Sakura... ok, pretty much every female ninja.\n\r\nAll the female ninjas in the series are portrayed as weak, emotional, annoying, bothersome, in-the-way, etc..  overall useless individuasl in a male oriented ninja world.\n\r\nSakura does nothing in fights other than get in the way and attempt to heal people (pretty much always failing) at the end.  When she's not failing, she's punching our friendly protagonist in the face and being an all around bitch.\n\r\nHinata is portrayed as thinking of Naruto all the time, like she has no life apart from her childhood crush, except from when she's being put down at home for being a girl.\n\r\nIno, short story, she's a bitch that you could never want to relate to.\n\r\nI'd have to say the only women in the whole series that isn't a total failure is Tsunade, because she doesn't take shit from anyone.  She still has her occasional emotional breakdown though.\n\n\r\n[Cons/Hate]\n\r\nFirst off, I love this series to death.  \n\r\nThe five minute episodes go by so fast, and I say five minutes because that's about all the time in each episode that isn't dedicated to some flashback of the last episode's flashback.\n\r\nWhen the plot is actually being advanced, it's exciting and attention holding.\n\r\nUnfortunately the show is also so entangled with filler episodes, which I skip, so much so that it feels like they make an episode once a  month!\n\n\r\n[Overall]\n\r\nGreat show, been following it weekly since the original Naruto series first aired.  If you are looking for something entertaining, this could very well be it.\n\r\nThis show would be great if you just start watching because you can browse through the currently 254 episodes, skipping over countless fillers and flashbacks, and actually enjoy the advancing plot, exciting battles, and interesting twists.\n\r\nEven though I consider Shippuden superior to the original series, I would recommend watching the original first to get some background as to what is going on, or you can actually watch the flashbacks.\n\r\n10/10 - I hope Naruto Shippuden stays alive.",
    "\n                An incredible work ethic and boundless determination should never be underestimated. \n\r\nAt first glance, Naruto Shippuuden, the continuation of Naruto, has a few noticeable differences. Firstly, Shippuuden shows its complexity and serious undertone early on in the series, through the obvious change in Naruto\u2019s personality. And secondly, protagonist is easily defined as Naruto, opposed to our duo of Naruto and Sasuke in the previous season.\n\r\nThe story of Shippuuden is driven through the ploy of the Akatsuki, whom are fixated on capturing the jinchuriki and extracting the tailed beasts within. The canonical plot of Shippuuden is definitely attention grabbing, through the use multiple plot twists and\n                  \n\nnumerous life or death situations. The non-canon plot however, is not so great. Overused flashbacks, dwelling on insignificant season one plot, and the apparent need to remind us of events that take place no less than a dozen episodes ago gets tiresome, quickly. It\u2019s truly a shame that the amount of filler in Shippuuden is so high, because the canon portion is outstanding. \n\r\nOnce the storyline unfolds after a few episodes the character cast of Shippuuden presents great depth and variety. Each of the reoccurring Hidden Leaf Village shinobi and kunoichi are developed to a great extent, they each have a unique back story and you\u2019re almost certain to find someone you can relate to, if not, become attached to. The ninja of the other main villages and the antagonists all display distinctive features that allow them to be memorable, be it the untouchable Kazekage, Gaara or the cunning missing-nin Orochimaru.\n\r\nThe quality of artwork in Shippuuden\u2019s canonical differs greatly from the non-canon. It\u2019s painfully obvious that the filler in Shippuuden is of a lower standard than its counterpart. With that being said, in the main storyline, Studio Pierrot has done a great job. Battle animations are fluid and eye-catching, the scenery is vivid and emotions are portrayed outstandingly. \n\r\nSimply, an outstanding soundtrack, those are the first words that come to mind when I think of Shippuuden. With outstanding openings such as OP3 \u201cBlue Bird\u201d almost welcoming you into an episode with open arms, and endings such as ED12 leaving you begging for more, the soundtrack of Shippuuden is definitely a memorable one. The composer Yasuharu Takanashi incorporates gritty strings, rhythmic percussion, penetrating woodwind instrumentals that captivate the moment, from intense, heart pumping battle music, to calm, vivid emotion evoking melodies, no expense is spared. \n\r\nOverall, Shippuuden is an amazing ride if you can either grind your way through the filler, or skip it entirely. The canonical plot more than makes up for the shortcomings presented though out its counterpart. Comedy is used at appropriate times, the action is engaging and the emotions are high. If I\u2019ve learnt anything from this viewing ,it\u2019s that sticking through the bad times with your head held high whilst never lowering your work ethic will rewarded, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely someday, believe it.",
    "\n                OK, this is my first review.\n\r\nSo far in Naruto Shippuuden, I got to say I enjoyed it but most find it slow because the days it's being aired and you have to wait 1-2 weeks. I, for one, read the manga, which is really starting to yet interesting but I also watch the anime, when the episodes come out. There are some who are starting to dislike Naruto Shippuuden because of &quot;fillers&quot; and yeah.\n\r\nOverall, I find the animation similar to the original Naruto, but there were some changes in it, too. There is and gonna be more action in Naruto Shippuuden, I can tell, since\n                  \n\nI read the manga, some do too. If you are a Naruto fan and just can't wait until the new releases for the episodes, I suggest to read the manga, there are some sites online like; onemanga.com. If you've seen the latest release of Naruto Shippuden, which is episode 27, you should start on Chapter 276. But it would be nice to keep up with the new releases of the episodes and chapters.\r\nThe new releases of chapters also take 1, sometimes 2, weeks to be release, similar to the episodes' releases, but the manga is way far ahead.\n\r\nThe Characters in Naruto are totally awesome and have interesting powers/skills/techniques, well, the characters that are going to appear, later on in Naruto Shippuuden, so the excitement of Shippuuden only just begun, there's much more that's gonna happen, Enjoy!\n\r\nI hope I did okay for my first review.",
    "\n                I find the series enjoyable and captivating at times although it does occasionally lose track of the main story due to filler episodes and becomes quite dull when it slows down a bit, it will frequently pull you back with spectacular fights and hilarious character situations that will keep you watching.\n\r\nOverall I recommend this anime because it makes you feel almost as though your are standing next to the characters, fighting alongside them and makes you hungry for ramen...\n\r\nYou will often find yourself getting attached to characters, whether it's because they are similar to you or you like the depth of their character you will\n                  \n\nfind yourself rooting for them whenever they are in trouble.",
    "\n                Did you enjoy watching Naruto, or are you still reading Naruto's manga, impatiently waiting for next chapter?\n\r\nThen Naruto Shippuuden is NOT for you.\n\r\nAs Naruto was an great anime, it's successor is just one, big soap opera. This &quot;work of art&quot; is overloaded with fillers and many sub-plots. What is more, every one fight or event is extended to the maximum possible amount of time - because of &quot;we-don't-want-to-reach-manga's-plot-so-soon&quot;.\r\nOh, look, it's Kakashi preparing an eye technique! In manga, it was prepared within 2 frames. In anime, it took _whole_5_eps_ to make it prepared (that's 5 weeks of waiting! o_O)\n\r\nIf you have plenty (I mean, very, very\n                  \n\nmuch) of free time and you're sure NOTHING will bore you, try watching Naruto Shippuuden.",
    "\n                How do I even sum up this series? How can I review something so special to me? Still, it must be done, so let me tell you why Naruto is a series you can't leave on your PTW list. \n\r\nLet's start with the basics: sound and art. Naruto (especially Shippuuden) has one of the best soundtracks in anime. Not only with its openings and endings, but its OST songs fit the anime and its tone better than any other anime I've seen. The art is GORGEOUS. Again, especially in Shippuuden because it's more recent compared to the older animation of the original Naruto series. The\n                  \n\nlighting effects and bright colors make every scene entrancing. \n\r\nI don't know whether to talk about the story or the characters next because both are as high quality as high quality can be, but I'll start with the characters. You can't FIND development like this anywhere else. For one thing, each character is indisputably unique, and it's nice to watch an anime in which you can find a piece of yourself in every character. Also, each of their stories-- heroes and villains alike-- was developed with such care that you can't help but be interested. More than both of those things, though, the sheer power that these characters hold is what really makes them remarkable. Not physical power (though, that type of power gets developed really nicely and realistically throughout the series as well), but mental power. These characters are written with goals and convictions that bring them to life in a way that will capture your heart. You'll become addicted to the characters simply because they give everything all they've got.\n\r\nNow, finally, we come to the story. This is going to be hard to talk about without getting detailed, so I'll keep it as brief as I can by saying this: this story is special. It isn't always unpredictable, and things don't always end happily, but the journey you'll take is-- dare I say-- one of the best you'll ever take. The care that was put into developing this story so that it had the most impact it could have must have been immense. This very well might be the only story I've ever experienced in which I didn't want to skip ahead to see the ending at some point. Every part of the story was important and made me feel so lucky to have found a story like it; I wanted to savor it as long as I could. The story itself is an art piece. \n\r\nA lot of that was my emotions reviewing the anime and not actual critiques, but isn't that more convincing? Naruto has become so special to me, and I'm really, really glad that I got past my assumptions about it beforehand and took the plunge to watch it. I don't think I'll ever find something quite like this again-- and that's why it's so beautiful. Please watch this if you're even a little curious because it'll change your life, I promise you. \n\r\n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3001\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden. One of the most hated series that is super popular. Why is it so hated? No real reason to be honest. Atleast that is what I believe. But don't worry I am not calling anyone who hate it 'morons' or whatever i'm just saying I 'think' it should NOT be as hated as it is. Not even CLOSE. I myself though think that episodes 1-110 aren't THAT good but after that is when it starts to become a 10/10 anime.\n\r\nI will get on to the why. And don't worry I will not make it too long since I think people won't read it\n                  \n\nall meaning it will all probably go to a big waste of time.\n\r\nI will not give a summary of the series because you can just read it in the main page or pretty much anywhere else.\n\r\nOK now I'll say why I gave it a 10. (Scored FILLER-FREE).\n\r\nAnimation (for the most part) gets a 10 and the music gets a 10 too (i also believe EVERYONE should give this a 10 music wise). I believe it has the best music ever along with One Piece CLOSELY beating the music of Pokemon, Bleach and Fairy Tail. The story gets incredible as it progresses and so does the level of enjoyment. Naruto and Sakura become better characters than before but Sasuke declines character wise (that's a given though since he does turn into a heartless villain). All the other characters are as awesome as they were from before (I myself only don't like Ino). The akatsuki are the main villains of the series and in my opinion best villains ever (beating Phantom Troupe and Homunculus  by a LITTLE). They have unique special abilities and are VERY fun to watch. And there's Sai, Sasuke's well ... replacement and he is actually not a bad character at all either especially as the story progresses. The action is superb and VERY entertaining and at times you don't know who is going to die (not mentioning names). Sometimes the action is clever too. A lot of strategy is going on in them. So as a result from these things there is too much suspense in it for words. It is unpredictable and VERY suspenseful. They are in such situations at times that you do not know how the problem might get solved.\n\r\nNow I will counter the negative things it might have/people say it has but some reasons might not be good. \n\r\nFirst problem people say it has- Some parts are RIP-OFF from hxh (both). I have watched hunter x hunter 2011 (my 2nd favourite anime if anyone is wondering where it goes in my personal rank) but I do not at all think this series is a ripoff of Hunter X. The whole eye deal is similar. But it is not a copy.More like inspiration. a copy is doing it exactly like it was but the eye deal in Naruto has a different twist and special things added to it. Like i'm pretty sure Kishimoto (the author of Naruto) knows that something this big will be noticed. Why did he do it? Because he knows it's no big deal or that it shouldn't be. And I haven't heard the author of hunter x complaining to him either so yeah Naruto is not a copy of hxh at all. And to anybody who mentions the hunter exam and Chuunin exam rewatch both they are VERY different. The concept (again) might have been taken but the actual content is EXTREMELY different. \n\r\nSecond problem people say it has- FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. Naruto doesn't have too many enjoyable ones but some (Chikara arc for example) are very good (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of Naruto (Shippuden in this case) filler' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip.\n\r\nThird problem people say it has- the length. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 4 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times).\n\r\nAnyways I know there might be reasons you will disagree with but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this a 10. Action, suspense, great animation, it is almost perfect (for me). \r\nFinally, I hope you enjoyed the review (took me quite a lot of time to do it) and that you give it a chance (especially from episode 110). Before that it is enjoyable but I find from episode 110 it's MIND-BLOWING.",
    "\n                Though I really like the storyline due to reading the manga I must say i'm really disappointed with Shippuuden.  Before this series came out I couldn't wait to see it because of how good the manga is but sadly I realized it's different.  Naruto Shippuuden has got to be one of the most boring animes out.  If you think you're gonna see an action packed anime think again for the characters stare at each other for 15 minutes before anything happens.  By the time the fight starts you're already asleep.  I don't recommend anyone watch this anime simply read the\n                  \n\nmanga.",
    "\n                after seeing 109 episodes\n\r\nStory: 7 - Good\r\nThe storyline is somehow predictable but it never failed to convince me to watch the next episode..

Mostly the sound was good. Openings and Endings are about 90% good.\n\n\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - Very Good\r\nSome have unique characteristics and others are common.

    "\n                Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of the series Naruto. Well, this is more exciting compared to the first one because it talks about a more mature Naruto. The plot is getting to its climax (according to the Mangaka) and it is really good to the point where it can make you cry. Trust me, you'll cry a lot of times because of this series. The art is good as well as the music. You'll enjoy the fight and every character. One thing that annoys me though, is the never ending fillers (because i really cant wait for the episode to continue). You wouldn't dare miss\n                  \n\nNaruto Shippuden.

    "\n                I only read the manga of it. \r\nBut the anime; I stopped at 263. \n\r\nThis anime is the like the COD of anime.  Well, you know why. \n\r\nIf you are a MAJOR Naruto fan-boy; then do not read this. And please be mature about this. I also want nice comments about this review. And it's a tad bit long. 'Tis appeal. \n\r\nWell: as known as some might say; THE MOST POPULAR ANIME IN THE WORLD. But, what I want to know is: ''Why?''. Is it because it is 'Tis an action anime or is it your favorite ongoing show? 4 years ago when\n                  \n\nI was in the 8th grade; I'm in 12th now. I used to love this show. But, there is something about this such as on fan-base and applause for this. Many also compare this show to other shows even some from a different genre. Like, some person at my school said that: NARUTO IS THE BETTER THAN FRUITS BASKET BECAUSE NARUTO HAS THE NINE TAIL CHAKRA!''. And many say that this anime can kick any other anime's ass. \n\r\nAnd I know it's an opinion. But, this starts a bad view of mere. \n\r\nAt my school, not a lot of people like anime and some don't even know what it is! Baffling! Pretty much; people at my school only care about sex, dating, and reality shows like ''Jersey Shore'' or ''My Big Redneck Island''. The few that know what anime/manga is only know about Naruto, Bleach, and the BIG 3. They are not real anime fans really. \r\nThey are just enthusiastic about anime. \n\r\nLet is be specific here: \n\r\nNaruto lacks character development. I don't want to spoil anything; but this has to do with THREE CHARACTERS that appeared in the manga and anime; but introductions for them was bad. \n\r\nAnd art was fine. \n\r\nStory was dreadful because with poor character development and there is no other form of intro to us when in lookout for other parts. Trying my best not to spoil.\n\r\nSound and music was good; ARR-DUFF! \n\r\nDecent enjoyment; but the story utter.......... \n\r\nOverall with the extra 2; well whatever.... \n\r\nI don't care about fillers or deaths. \n\n\r\nBIG 3? Really, it also gets boring. \n\n\r\nAnd annoying characters? Well, there are some.......\n\n\r\nThe only character I like is Gaara. \n\r\nAnd no more: ''BELIEVE IT!'' \n\r\nThat's my review.",
    "\n                Naruto: Shippuden - what can I say? I used to love this shit. Back in 2007 I would wait for the episodes, coming back from school every Friday to excitedly check whether or not the latest episode had been uploaded and subbed. Unfortunately I no longer find the series nearly as enjoyable as before.\n\r\nSTORY \n\r\n I know this might anger all you angry Naruto fanboys out there, but come on guys, where is the story in Naruto: Shippuden? All it's about is our title character, Naruto, trying to bring Sasuke back from the dark side. I admit that Kishimoto isn't as bad as Kubo in\n                  \n\nthis department (who seems to be making the shit up as he goes along; either that or he likes trolling us (eg: \"Who said the Espada numbers go from 1-10?!?!\" *trollface*) but of course that is an entirely different matter. All I can say is that at least Kishimoto seems to plan a few weeks in advance). I wonder if people ever get bored of Naruto chasing after Sasuke. \n\r\n\"But no, psyxwar, Naruto isn't just about him chasing after Sasuke!\" I hear you say. Maybe you have a point. It seems that the series is now about the Akatsuki, a criminal organisation, chasing after \"tailed beasts\", beasts of \"chakra\" (that's Naruto terminology for energy, ki, etc) with tails and their plan of world domination. I agree. There seems to be a little variation in events. This is why I have given Naruto: Shippuden a very generous score of \"2\" for Story. \n\r\nOf course, you, being the passionate, die-hard Naruto fanboy that you are, probably do not accept my reasoning and justification for giving Naruto: Shippuden a \"2\" in the Story department. Fair enough. But shouldn't you put this into perspective? Would you read a book that had a guy chasing another guy as its plot? I know I wouldn't. \n\r\ntl;dr: Naruto: Shippuden is about a guy chasing another guy\n\r\nART \n\r\nThe art of the anime is okay - nothing exceptional, but pretty good nonetheless. There are countless examples of newer animes with better art and more fluid animation, but I won't hold this against Naruto: Shippuden. I've seen far worse in my years as an otaku.\n\r\nSOUND\n\r\nThe sound is good as well, but again, nothing exceptional. I would usually skip over the same opening after watching it one or two times which usually just means it's \"meh\". There was nothing godly like \"Hare Hare Yukai\" (where I would watch that every. single. time.) \n\r\nCHARACTER\n\r\nThe character development and characters in general admittedly weren't that bad. Naruto definitely develops in skill (and maturity?) a fair bit over the course of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything so I won't really elaborate further on the issue of character development. I'd like to add that despite somewhat \"maturing\", this may simply be superficial as he still chases after Sasuke. He should know by now that he's a goddamn sociopath and wants to kill everyone and destroy his village. The characters are for most part unique with their own personalities. \n\r\nENJOYMENT\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Meh, it was alright. Nothing exceptional. I feel as if I've wasted hours upon hours watching this shit though. I feel that if I wasn't such a dedicated fanboy in my youth, I would have enjoyed this series a lot less.\n\r\nTHE VERDICT: 4/10\r\n\"PRETTY BAD\"",
    "\n                Okay so after seeing so many bashings of the anime i've finally had enough and decided to write my own review.\n\r\nSTORY:10/10\n\r\nOkay so the story is the same as the original Naruto series or rather almost the same , because as the characters develop and change so does the plot. And even though everyone complains about how the whole \"Save-my-best-friend-from-the-evil\" is really cliche i have to disagree. The story is so much more than saving Sasuke if you have failed to see that then it's understandible why you don't like the anime. Every character in the anime  and their own story can be made into\n                  \n\ndifferent animes that's how interesting some of their past and future acts are.There are alot of plot twists and i don't know about you guys but i find the idea to split Naruto into two part , Naruto and Shippuuden as in young and older, is really great. Even though we have this gap of 2.5 years of training ,as the anime progresses further we ,step by step, begin to uderstand just how much the charcaters and their atitutes have changed.\n\n\r\nART:9.7/10\n\r\nI don't know about ypu but i personally love the art , true at some point it does get lower in quality but i still like it. The fight scence are done really well ,you know the more inportant fights.Lately as the Kage Summit arc has started  the animation is really smooth and good, too.\n\r\nSOUND:10/10\n\r\nThe openings and endings are great i don't know just how many of them i have downloaded and i listen to them ,like, everyday.The backround music is fitting too and the voice actors are doing an amazing job so far, too .I can't even imagine what it would be if the VAs change .\n\r\nCHARACTERS:10/10\n\r\nOkay this is one of Shippuuden;s strong points, if not the strongest. Every character,almost, has development and if you actually look into them you'll see that Naruto, the main hero,  has one of the littlest developments. We see that Sakura is stronger and she doesn't cry that much she is more independent and she has some feelings for Naruto as well , to what extent is unknown yet. Shikamaru's stories is also one of the best and we get to see just how responsible and genious he is. Sasuke is well.........Sasuke but he has changed alot too [ and i actually started to like him ] His and Itachi's stories is amazing you have to see thaat it's really complicaded and yet sp meaningfull and tragicly beautiful. Gaara has really been opening up to people , he smiles sometimes and he is friendlier and he puts alot of effort to change and act like a normal person.So as you can see most of the characters's backrounds are revealed even the Akatsuki members's and it's done in a really good way.\n\n\r\nENJOYMENT:10/10\n\r\nNaruto/Shippuuden is one of the best animes I have evr seen , even though i used to not like it so much at one point . The fillers i have nothing to say about, every long anime has fillers so that it won't chatch up to the manga that way there won't be anything to animate.\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\n\r\nI love this show mainly 'cuz at first it seems so childish and so smiple but it's actually alot more complicated and wonderful but i guess it's not really for everyone.\n\r\nP.S I enjoy feedback and sorry for the grammar mistakes :)",
    "\n                Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. \n\r\nShippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite\n                  \n\nof the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja.  \n\r\nIt is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. \n\r\nWhile Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant.",
    "\n                Before I even start the review, I would like to mention this is based off of the anime only.\n\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI have to admit Shippuden starts off weak, but gets better once you reach the Hidan and Kakazu Arc which is the 5th anime arc. Then it keeps getting better until the Shinobi War Arc where both the manga and anime go way downhill. I always found Naruto had the best pacing and the most consistent story out of the big three. Even though many fillers, it wasn't until the War Arc where it started to directly affect the canon material and this was due to\n                  \n\ncanon episodes and filler episodes being mixed together in one arc.\n\r\nArt 1/10\r\nAt first I defended Shippuden's animation because it was just new, not worse. And it was like that for a long time. Then came the famous fight between Naruto and the final Pein where the animation was just horrendous. Then it got a bit better, but when the 5 Kage Summit Arc started, animation began to go downhill. The point where I stopped defending the animation was the double episode 220 & 221. This double episode was the most inconsistent animated episode I have ever seen. Even if you are an anime only watcher, you could tell canon from filler just based on how the scene was animated. I am serious on this. But that wasn't even the worst yet! And the next example I am going to use may not be either since at this point it is only at episode 321, and unfortunately the animation may get even worse. Anyways the worst animated was episode 298. This was the first episode of a 2 episode fight; the fight Naruto and Killer B vs Itachi and Nagato. Don't get me wrong episode 2 was also bad but this was worse. Not only did the characters look like rag dolls swinging around when they fought, but Itachi didn't even look like Itachi. At least in episode 2 he looked like himself. And BTW these were canon episodes.\n\r\nSound 9/10\r\nI've always like the openings and endings better in Shippuden than in Part One. I guess they are more of my type of music. As for the soundtrack, it was different than Part One, but I enjoyed it just as much. I have always found that the OST's in both Part 1 and 2, were matched perfectly with the scene and the music is just really overly well done.\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\r\nWhy I am giving this such a low score is because all attention is focused on either Naruto or Sasuke and every other character that showed promise in part one, seemed to be instantly dropped from the canon material. At least the fillers gave them a bit of spotlight, but in my opinion it was by no means enough.\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\r\nWhy I am giving this such a low score is because of all the filler that interrupts the series. Now that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the filler was good, but its just really bad; except for the Konoha History Arc which was done well.\n\r\nOverall 5/10\r\nFace it, Shippuden just isn't as good as part 1. Maybe if Masashi Kishimoto would have focused on making more characters a part of part two and he paid even a little attention to what goes on in the anime, it might have been decent.",
    "\n                Here I am, typing out my second review of Naruto. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about this series, and not in a good way either. But first, let me tell you why I even bothered with this series.\n\r\nIf you were in middle-high school in the mid to late 2000s, then chances are you were exposed to the full brunt of the Naruto craze. I was in 5th or 6th grade at the time and all I was ever exposed to were AMVs. It wasn't until a few years later that I decided to take it upon myself to watch the series to the bitter end.\n                  \n\nAnd what a wonderful mistake that was. Alright, with all the personal bullshit out of the way, let's get to business. Since I'm lazy, I'll just write a review for the original series by extension as well. \n\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAbout as predictable as you can imagine. Some bratty kid has an overly ambitious goal and the story revolves around him trying to reach it. And of course, he does, and some people might argue that the suspense lies in how it all happened. In other words, when there's already a foregone conclusion, all the stuff in the middle is supposed to be exciting. While the story is not necessarily \"unexciting\", it IS drawn out, bland, and riddled with plot holes. Villains are constantly revealed to be mere puppets for an increasingly more powerful villain, and all Naruto has to do to convince them to his way of thinking is talk to them. Rinse and repeat like four or five times. The story also contains way more characters than it can handle, as key characters from early on in the series, like Orochimaru, are simply forgotten in favor of other plot developments. The bigger fights can easily span over 5 episodes, leading to the action being just as slow as the plot progression. Ultimately, the story seems to take its focus off of Naruto and his journey to reach his goal and devolve into a somehow even less interesting Uchiha clan soap opera.\n\r\nArt: 4/10\n\r\nThe art is nothing spectacular but also not totally hideous to look at. The REAL flaw lies in its animation, which fluctuates in quality and shows a lack of care on the animators' part. Everyone knows the notorious Naruto vs Pain fight, one of the most major fights in the series. In an attempt to make the animation look more fluid and polished, the character's faces and bodies are stretched and skewed and basically everything goes to hell. Plus, there's the animators' crippling inability to draw faces or objects that are far away. Some of the filler characters are either intentionally ugly or just lazily drawn, but we're not touching those. \n\r\nSound: 7/10\n\r\nThe soundtrack is admittedly pretty impressive. I mean, it's normal to get sick of the opening after the tenth or so time, but some of them really shine. The music is a mix of traditional Japanese instruments and punk rock, and somehow they just mesh so well together. However, I can't particularly choose a favorite track. There are very few that really stand out, but all of them are great. However, I think I have a clear bias towards Shippuden's soundtrack, because it feels grander and more emotional. \n\r\nCharacter: 2/10 (this is gonna be a long one)\n\r\nFor me, THIS is where the series truly fails. As I said before, Naruto has way more characters than its story can handle. Stories with large casts that all have good development is possible, but this is not the case for Naruto. The first problem is that the main characters are significantly less interesting than the side characters could be. Naruto is designed to be a goofy yet charismatic guy who just draws people to him without explanation, but instead comes off as annoying and preachy. He inexplicably converts the worst of villains to his way of thinking, and it comes off as just plain stupid. It's possible to have one character be a moral compass and not have everyone worship them. Then there's Sasuke, who's designed to be a polar opposite to Naruto, but instead comes off as an edgelord. Rounding off the main cast is Sakura, who is supposed to be a strong heroine type but instead comes off a doormat who lets Sasuke toy with her emotions and relies on Naruto to do shit for her.\n\r\nThe main cast is simply bland, but it's the villains I was most disappointed with because of how they were handled. After shaping them up to be generic  bad guys without feeling or remorse, Kishimoto likes to trick you into feeling bad for them by slapping on a tragic backstory, usually shortly before or even after their death. Their backstories almost always involve the death of a loved one driving them to their current state. This is part of Naruto's message about forgiveness, but it still doesn't work as a narrative device. To make a villain sympathetic, you have to humanize them while they're still alive. The other reason Kishimoto fails at writing tragic villains is because their true motives are usually only presented to the audience as opposed to the characters in the story, and so the good guy never questions what they're doing (not that this would have worked anyway). In short, Kishimoto shouldn't have even bothered trying to make most of the villains sympathetic. \n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\n\r\nAs you can tell, I got bored with this series after all was said and done. Almost the entire cast was underdeveloped, and while the side characters had the most potential, they slowly but inevitably became part of the Naruto circlejerk that encompassed the entire ninja world. The animation tends to fluctuate depending on the animator's budget, and the story is exactly what you would expect from the Big Three: bland, incomplete, and way longer than it needs to be. I should mention that one of Naruto's messages is that previous generations should carve the path for the next generation to take their place. Now that its glory days have long since past, I think Naruto should do the same.",
    "\n                I have to say, shippuuden's a great show, but naruto could've started shippuuden a little after the sasuke retrival arc, and skip all of the ridiculous fillers!\n\n\r\n          But thats not the point, the point is that shippuuden's a great anime pick if you want your fill of great naruto action and comedy!(filler free, mind you) The show's pretty good itself, but one of the flaws that most animes have is theres TOO much talking and flashbacks during fights! I mean, when some ninjas bust in to an evil ninja groups lair, you dont have conversations with\n                  \n\nthem!!!!! But overall, the shows great! Also, it has one of the best theme songs EVER!!!! If you've finished the entire naruto series, then shippuuden's a great choice for you!",
    "\n                I really love this series. Since the first inception of Naruto in 2007 up until now, I have not been disappointed. Naruto, a seemingly trite and boistrous young man who wants to become the next Hokage in the hidden leaf is now fighting to keep his friends and family from harm from the most volatile enemy he can ever face, which is Sasuke Uchiha. A long time classmate until Sasuke's sudden disappearance to join a hidden group of cut throat killers. Naruto now finds himself closer to his nine tailed demon as a partner rather than foe because of his mothers implanted consciousness. With the\n                  \n\nhelp of her, Naruto nears his goal of attaining the most powerful demon as his own weapon. But he still has a few fights left to overcome the obstacle. However in the middle, are his new friends from the hidden cloud clan. Bee, a man of weird intelligence which he likes to mix with rap in a conversation, helps Naruto beat his Nine tailed fox to such a degree, that the fox has no choice now but to listen. Yet their foe the Akatsuki, still need to acquire the nine tail fox in order to bring back the original demon - The ten tailed fox. All that is left is Naruto's and Bee's demons to make it happen. In the middle is Sasuke who wants nothing more than to destroy the hidden leaf, and with the akatsuki's help, his dream might be realized. Although now, with naruto's new powers of his sage mode and nine tail, sasuke will have even more of a challenge using his own dark evil demon. I think this series is great, to see naruto grow up from series episode to the next until his teen years, to now where he is virtually a full grown man, is enlightening. I have to say that for all the anime's I've watched, the story just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait until the huge final showdown between Sasuke and Naruto. But for now, I want to watch the Naruto Blood Prison movie coming soon. That should be quite the story.",
    "\n                This thing which many of you call anime used to be cool at some point until the producers decided to just destroy with loads of fillers. Of course, it was never a top anime. The twists and the storytelling is fine but I don't understand why is everything so Cliche in it. I mean, one character dies on the battlefield and everyone just stand still and stop fighting and look at that dying character. Also the dialogues appear to be the work of 9 year old writers. The art is fine but it got very bad in some critical points like the Pain arc. (I'm\n                  \n\npretty sure everyone remembers the crappy animation and style during Naruto's fight with pain)\r\nThe character development is fine also but they ruin it by giving them too many crappy dialogues.\r\nOverall it is good at some certain points but the story started to get worse and worse with time until recently when the story was just totally destroyed.",
    "\n                Naruto makes up one of the Big 3. This review shall be for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden and shall contain my opinion of Naruto while trying to be as unbiased as possible. Before anyone asks, yes I have read Naruto entirely, and it was one of my first mangas/anime and I was somebody who thought Naruto was a perfect anime before realizing its fair share of flaws and before watching/reading other animes/mangas.\n\r\nProgression (6): Naruto is a manga with 700 chapters... 700 CHAPTERS, it is definitely long and of course has some useless arcs which make you wonder what the point of that\n                  \n\narc was. There are also useless conversations that feel repeated between two characters in the show, and there are the past of characters remembered that are often repetitive. However, the fight sequences are done absolutely spectacularly. The hype level while major fights occur are often unreal and are often deserved because the fight scenes are quite good.\n\r\nStory (4): The story of Naruto is somewhat mediocre to be very brutally honest. It is riddled with Deus Ex Machina writing, so much so that the fans have dubbed the very often Deus Ex Machina writing with a term called \"Plot no Jutsu.\" There are also some plot holes within the show, but I do not find too much fault with the plot holes as any show this long shall probably have at least one plot hole. The themes of Naruto would be good if they were not told from a black and white morality viewpoint in which the victor of the battle was always correct. Also the themes are not depicted very well (as with the case of Neji believing that heritage meant everything, and oddly enough turning out to be correct in the end as we find out who Naruto's father is, even though he concludes that heritage does not matter.) The biggest theme in this show seems to be about friendship, and although it's interesting the first and second time they talk about it, it becomes too repetitive whenever all Naruto says is his answers are his friends. Humor also loses its effect in the story when it's done in the middle of the story which breaks immersion. I wouldn't mind it if it was a slight chuckle, but the fact that they are trying to make you laugh uncontrollably drives you away from the story.\n\r\nArt (8): The art is not anything to write home about in Naruto, however the fight scenes are done very well. Very little times have I seen fight scenes in other anime and manga be able to compare to Naruto.\n\r\nSound (10): The music in Naruto goes very well at times with what is going on in Naruto. In fact some soundtracks are good enough to be listened to without any accompaniment of the episode, such as \"Sadness and Sorrow.\"\n\r\nCharacters (1): My reviews are always honest, and being honest, I must be brutally honest that the characters in Naruto were AWFUL. The reason why I say this is that although there are interesting characters in the show, they become quite insignificant. My point is this, there are maybe 10 characters that matter in the entirety of Naruto, and everyone else could have never existed and the plot would have been relatively the same. Fan favorite characters such as Rock Lee or Neji become insignificant enough that towards the end of the manga, my brother (who also reads this with me) asked me who Rock Lee and Neji were. The characters that do matter are often cliche and even boring. There is the main character who falls very easily into the shonen mainstream hero archetype, there is the angry child archetype, the girl who has a crush archetype, and the wise teacher archetype.\n\r\nEnjoyment (5): Although the story was not very great and the characters were terrible, at the end of the day the product was still somewhat enjoyable. The main reason why was because of the fight scenes and the fact that you get to see MAGICAL NINJAS FIGHTING. If that isn't an awesome setup for spectacular fight scenes, then I do not know what is. However, the really boring and generic story, the boring characters, and the nothing that often happened in an arc puts this score down quite a bit.\n\r\nTLDR?\n\r\nPros:\n\r\n*The fight sequences are spectacular\r\n*Good soundtrack with the fight scenes\r\n*Chuunin Exam arc has remained up to date one of the best shounen arcs I have seen\r\n*The humor can be funny as a pick-me-up.\n\r\nCons:\n\r\n*Terrible Story - Much deus ex machina (plot no jutsu) writing, or writing that feels as though it were made up in the last moment, and there are few plot holes. The plot holes are faulted slightly less by the fact that any story this long will probably have at least one plot hole.\r\n*The length of the story is far too long. It loses much charm and interest after such long periods of time. After a while you lose immersion.\r\n*Much filler (doesn't really apply to the manga or to those who skip filler so it does not have much minus on the review)\r\n*Very cliche characters, and the minor characters who were fan favorites become completely irrelevant to the point where they could be nonexistent and nothing would change.\r\n*Themes are not depicted well, especially with the black-white morality. It feels as though whoever wins the battle has the correct viewpoint which is narrow-minded.\r\n*Plot often feels repetitive, just about everyone has lost somebody close to them in the past and have decided to become the villain because of that.\r\n*The pacing is inconsistent. At times you'll be going down a rollercoaster ride having a character learn much at one time, other times Naruto will be yelling Sasuke's name and looking for him in a fruitless attempt to reconcile.\r\n*The humor can also get in the way of the story. At times, the tone will be feeling more serious, but when comic relief (beyond a chuckle) happens the atmosphere is broken, immersion is lost, and you lost the chance of taking that scene very seriously.\n\r\nOverall Score: 5.5/10 (Just round it up to 6/10)\n\r\n***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it. If you enjoy/hate this anime/manga, feel free to accept my thoughts on said anime/manga or discard it.",
    "\n                Covering the 2nd half of Naruto manga, Shippuden adapts the teenaged years of the titular character. I wanna start this review by admitting that I am quite thankful there were people who managed to really enjoy the full road Shippuden brings. It's a long one, 500 episodes counting filler and around 300 even if you aren't. It took me 5 months to get through all the material skipping everything filler related. Now, it's actually been quite a while since I finished Shippuden (finished it last November) but I feel with a clearer head now's a better time than ever to go over everything with the\n                  \n\nseries.\n\r\nI enjoyed very little of Naruto Shippuden.\n\r\nTo start with, Naruto is... Well, not a very fun protagonist to say the least. He starts off the series seeming at least a little more mature and less annoying than his original counterpart but as the series goes on his character takes a complete nosedive and it was hard for me to really enjoy him as a character by the end. His obsession with getting Sasuke back (who at the end of Naruto abandoned the Hidden Leaf to join that series' big bad in a move that would've potentially ended with his death), while understandable, feels completely unbelievable and unjustified. I feel this could've been corrected by exploring both characters similarities (which happens... 470 episodes in...) But for the majority of the series the goal of bringing back Sasuke feels so hard to care about. Another one of the main characters I enjoyed very little of was Sakura. Sakura is actually just not good. Her character in the previous series, while annoying and mostly unlikable, made sense. She was the most realistic of the cast, reacting to events how an actual 12 year old girl would in the events. Her treatment of Naruto and obsession over Sasuke back then felt understandable and it led me not to really dislike her much.\n\r\nEnter Shippuden Sakura.\n\r\nShe starts off fairly well with some new abilities (becoming stronger plus learning to heal from Tsunade). However this only lasts for one story arc as by the second story arc she's reverted back to her old ways fairly quickly, rarely amounting to much in the story. She gets one cool moment towards the end of the Ninja World War when Team 7 reunities but not only is the scene poorly built up, aside from landing a good blow to the final villain she doesn't do too much. As a character her interactions with Naruto are dreadful. Really amounting to nothing more than Sakura deriding Naruto for being stupid, praising him for managing to do things despite that or maybe sometimes a little bit of hero worship. However she hits her absolute lowest as a character anytime something involves Sasuke. Her little childhood crush never goes away and while it doesn't seem to bad, the 5 Kage Summit arc is just... Well lemme explain.\n\r\nOnce Sasuke is officially labeled a rouge ninja which means he must be eradicated, the majority of the original Genin kids (Sans Naruto and of course Sasuke) decide that'll it'll be up to them to take care of Sasuke. Sakura however decides to fight him on her own. I didn't mind this because it shows a small semblance of character development. However she struggles to do so due to still being in love with him and honestly she is unable to hold a candle to a weaker Sasuke (having just killed a man after all). I find it very disappointing and really dumb of Sakura. \n\r\nOtherwise, the cast of characters in this series is VERY expansive but good luck seeing them on screen at all. Older characters that could use development or could be used in new arcs end up getting replaced with new characters who serve on simple purpose and then usually get put on a bus and forgotten anyways. Heya Sai, Taka members. The one exception to this is Shikamaru, the only member of the original Konoha 12 that isn't Naruto or Sasuke who continues to develop. He actually gets his own story arc, the first story arc in the anime to actually be above \"meh\" level. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good. Otherwise, the cast of characters is mostly dreadful in this arc. However I will admit: even many months later Shippuden has some great villains. Wasn't big on Orochimaru in the original series, so the amount of good villains actually surprised me. Whether they be mini-bosses like Hidan, Kakazu, that one guy who flies on a clay bird and uses explosives (forgot his name my bad) or Itachi. The bigger bads are definitely some of the best though. Pain and Obito are still my two favorite anime antagonists. Kinda surprising considering my thoughts on the rest of the series so far...\n\r\nThough to be honest I still don't like Madara. He's not really bad, just very basic imo.\n\r\nThat being said, what about the story.\r\n*Large exhale*\n\r\nThe story isn't bad when it starts off if I'm gonna be honest, but they aren't really all that great either. I felt very little reason to care about the story, a thing which I blame on it's characters. It's not until a major character dies around 70 episodes in where I actually found myself getting invested in the series. Episode 81 (The Episode titled \"Team 10\" is one of the most well directed anime episodes I believe. From there on the series begins to start getting back to original Naruto levels of decent. Sasuke's fight with Itachi, the reveal of Pain, many major plot events all culminating in \"The Pain Invasion\" as Naruto becomes the last objective of the Akatsuki's hit list. While overall the arc tends to become quite frustrating (One notable thing being that Naruto isn't around for most of the invasion, training in another dimension, which is something that could actually work in the other characters advantage as Naruto's capture would mean the end of the world. However Tsunade objects, wanting Naruto to be apart of the fight which is a bad idea in every way knowing how more experienced fighters lost to Pain and Naruto is a 16 year old). However the fight between Naruto and Pain makes up for it. A battle between two different ideas of peace with some amazing animation and Naruto's subsequent breakdown towards the end I'd quite heartbreaking. However, at the very end Naruto simply talks Pain out of his evil ways turning him good. While this is a fairly common Naruto story element and on that I defend in fact, it was poorly implimented and was the beginning of the final downfall of Shippuden. I could go on about the Fourth Great Ninja War arc but it's fairly lengthy (About 2/3's of the whole anime) and so a rant would probably be quite long. Overall the plot sets itself up as interesting but nothing interesting actually happens. I found more often the not I'd either be anticipating a singular event that was to take place in the story, or just straight up anticipating the arcs ending. \n\r\nCan I also talk about the series' animation? The art design becomes a lot softer and more exaggerated as the series continues, which I appreciate. However for the most part the characters look and move stiffly no matter where the series is. Every now and then the series gets its best animators on a single episode (mostly fights with spectacular results see Sakura vs Sasori, Sasuke vs Deidara and Naruto vs Sasuke) but this is only 5% of a 500 episode anime. The show looks DREADFUL through and throughout \n\r\nI can say though: Its soundtrack is phenomenal. Probably my favorite or second favorite soundtrack. It's a little weak at the start but by the end of the ninja world war it really hits its peak. \n\r\nHonestly what can I say about Shippuden. It really hurt to get through and unless there's some sort of Shippuden Kai, I'm never watching this series again.\n\r\nOh, but one thing before I finish this review. Don't forget how the series tore down it's whole heartwarming idea that hard work will pay off. Naruto, who was always played up as the underdog who came from nothing, turned out to be not only the chosen one, but was also related the VARIOUS strong individuals from the past (1st Hokages wife is his ancestor. Son of the 4th Hokage. Reincarnation of ninja Jesus etc).\n\r\n*Sigh*\n\r\nWhy Kishimoto... Why...",
    "\n                I was all into this show back when I was was in middle school. At some point later, this show was moving too slow for me so i started going with it through the manga releases. Eventually I ran out of time and lost rhythm with the anime. I ended up finishing the manga version though. I already know what happens story wise. This manga is too slow paced and long winded. They could of made this show happen in 250 episodes combined. Both naruto and shippuuden. Instead it became a cash cow and quality suffered. It could be I fell out of love with\n                  \n\nthis show because perhaps my tastes changed as I got older.  It was one of my favorite shows when I first started watching it. Then when at some point during high school it just didn't attract me, it ended up feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyment. \n\r\nStory wise it started out good, then became way too repetitive and predictable. They drag things out for no reason. Its not like this show will make you think on a deeper level. The plot is basically what you would expect for a shonen anime. Nothing artistic or out of the ordinary. \n\r\nOverall, i would give this anime a 6/10. If you asked me to rate 10 years ago I would of given it an 8 or 9 out of 10.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden is the long awaited sequel of Naruto. Naruto is a good anime that's  why it's no wonder why it became so popular,however Naruto Shippuden  ruined it.\n\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nNaruto Shippuden started off really good, at least it didn't failed everyone's expectation after the long wait. It was nice to see Naruto and the rest grew up as teenagers -with their new missions and new journey. However... as the series continue, the story started to get messed up and slowly went downhill. The story started to focus more on Naruto and Sasuke's relationship - on how Naruto wanted to keep his promise to Sakura\n                  \n\nand bring Sasuke back. The fights took so long, not because a fierce fight was going on but because of the long talks during the fight.\n\r\nArt: 2/10\r\nThe characters doesn't look as good as before. The animation is also really bad, it looks so dull. There were fight scenes that could've been great to watch, but because of bad animation, it became boring to watch. There are also times when the characters look distorted -especially during fight scenes.\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\r\nNothing much has change from the characters...except:\r\nSome old characters that we thought of as cool ended up doing nothing really helpful and ended up like side characters.\r\nThere are new interesting characters but the attention for them slowly fade.\r\nThe are lots of characters that wasn't given the attention and development that they deserve.\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\r\nIt is really sad... how a good series ended up being disappointing",
    "\n                This is one of those childhood anime that is full of memories, but after I watched it thoroughly, I decided not to recommend this anime.\n\r\nThe reason is simple, there are too many flashbacks in each episode, this is the worst motive for stalling time in my opinion. there are a lot of useless episodes but most of them are filled with flashbacks which are very long, long, very long and even take up several episodes.\n\r\nI don't have a problem with flashbacks from each character, but the problem is the positioning, for example, I was enjoying watching Naruto fight but suddenly I met another character and\n                  \n\nthe flashback started, seriously?\r\nThe worst thing was the flashback of Sakura saying to bring Sasuke back, I was really tired of hearing that, I don't know how many times I had to hear Sakura's cries for help!\n\r\nSo in conclusion, this anime is good, but there are many negative points, especially for flashbacks, imperfect placement, as long as you put flashbacks anywhere, In other words, this anime is too fixated on flashbacks, really badly, and what's worse is that the same flashback is played again in other episodes, only with a few scenes added, and this applies to other flashbacks.\n\r\nThis should have added the Drama genre, because it's a lot more crap compared to action.",

Some people say that this is the worst anime ever while there are also some other people who say that this is the best anime ever. After catching up to the latest episode, I can safely say that this is not the best anime and it is also not the worst anime ever.\n\r\nStory : 7/10\r\nNow before you start watching this show make sure that you must watch the prequel as you will not understand a single thing without watching the prequel. The show begins with Naruto returning to his\n                  \n\nvillage , Konohagakure after 3 years of training with the legendary sannin Jiraiya. He looks stronger , taller and more muscular however he has not learn any new jutsu at all even after training for THREE YEARS. The organization , Akatsuki has also began to take action as they are starting to take action as they are slowly kidnapping the Jinchurikis for their plan. A new dark threat lies ahead and also Orochimaru is also planning to make Sasuke his new vessel and Naruto must save him from it before it happens. Now the story is pretty standard and good however the only thing that makes me frustrated is that there are always fillers that makes you think what the hell is this? What is the point of showing this? If only there are no fillers and freaking 10 minute flashbacks that always happen frequently this show would have been definitely less than 400 episodes.However, if you remove all the fillers and flashbacks, you will have a fantastic story which is filled with great action and some of the saddest scenes I have ever seen. Unfortunately the story is overshadowed by huge amount of fillers that is just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, there were some fillers that were just plain awesome such as the Kakashi anbu arc which is a must watch.\n\r\nArt : 7/10\r\nThe art of Naruto Shippuuden is definitely a lot better than its prequel. There were some ups and downs which there were some episodes which the art just looked plain weird but there were some episodes in which the art looked fantastic (Episode 322). Overall the art is average and there is really nothing much to complain or admire about.\n\r\nSound : 7/10\r\nThe soundtrack for Naruto Shippuuden is pretty fantastic. There were some ost that I listen to frequently (Pain's theme). The openings and endings are pretty average as there were some which is so awesome (opening 6 and 16) and there were some that were just plain awful. Overall the soundtrack is pretty decent as there were nothing to complain about.\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\r\nThe characters are the keypoint and the best part of the show. Each and every character always has enough depth and background which shows you why are they doing this. Naruto Uzumaki has really received so much character development and has grown from a young kid who loves to pull pranks to a strong and dependable adult. The supporting characters are all fantastic and amazing especially Uchiha Itachi and the Fourth Hokage who are both just plain awesome. My only complain about the characters is Sakura Haruno who at first looks like she has become stronger and more independent but as the story progressed, you can see that the author just doesn't give a crap about her and makes her do all the annoying things. Hell the only thing she did was yell either Naruto or Sasuke's name. The fillers character were also just annoying. For example there was this kid who keeps talking about his home which annoyed me to no end. Despite me complaining so much about the characters the characters were really great and it was really entertaining to watch them do the things they do.\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6/10\r\nTo be honest I really enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden main story but when it comes to the fillers all my excitement goes down the drain and I just multitask while watching it. For example the current episode is also a filler which seriously pissed me off as they just showed an incredible twist then boom they suddenly show a flashback about a story which I don't give a damn about. Well the show is really enjoyable when it comes to the main plot.\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\r\nOverall Naruto Shippuuden has its ups and downs. Hell I cried like a baby so many times at some scenes which were incredibly sad. I also had goosebumps at some scenes which were just plain awesome. Naruto Shippuden is definitely a lot more mature and better than it's prequel and best part of all is that people actually die in this anime. Such a pity that the large amount of fillers and flashbacks really drags this show down as if they remove the flashbacks and fillers from the show, I would have given this show a 9/10. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my review!",
    "\n                I've seen all the episodes broadcast so far, what I can say is that it confirms the expectations I had of this anime, which is one of the best ever made.\r\nPast the filler, the series opens in new facets in an incredible way, and the story begins to take hold, smooth as glass with great skill, as it happens in the manga. The only criticism that I can relate to the graphics, which compared to the first series has dropped in quality, not much is clear, however, an improvement was due at least as quality goes the others Anime. The sound, I would say that\n                  \n\nthere are not equal, along with Bleach, I think they are the best soundtracks ever made for an anime, there are no words to describe the great and splendid quality of the music that accompany the anime.\r\nThere is everything in Naruto, comedy, drama, spectacular fights, psychology ... I repeat, nothing is missing. For this reason I think it is superior to all other anime of its kind, even when compared to giants like Dragon Ball.\r\nThe last comment: Although perfection does not exist, I put 10 because I saw that the negative votes were the result of the insertion of filler which in effect have created much discussion, I shared it too, but it seems too fall into exasperation, because they are interesting and related to story.\r\nSTORY: The story starts from the drain Sasuke. The protagonist in the meantime has to train to be able to bring home his friend and defend himself against Akatsuki, an organization that wants to capture all the devils with tails, also it is precisely in this series that you discover many secrets, like the story of Uchiha\u2019s clan or Naruto\u2019s parents.\r\nCHARACTERS: here are introduced to new characters very well characterized, especially the Akatsuki\u2019s members.\r\nFIGHTS: here fights are a bit longer and made much better than the first series, in some cases are even epic.",
    "\n                Naruto is my favorite anime so this review will be a long one.\n\r\nIf I had to describe Naruto in just one sentence, I would say, \"An Epic Journey of Ninjas, Friendship, and Self-Discovery.\"\n\r\nThis masterpiece not only offers epic and thrilling battles but also presents rich and profound character development, engaging storytelling, and a lasting message of perseverance and friendship. As someone who grew up following Naruto, this journey was more than just an anime - it was a fundamental part of my own growth journey.\n\r\nLet's start with the fights. Naruto is widely recognized for its intense and exciting battles, skillfully choreographed and full of thrilling\n                  \n\ntwists. From the epic clashes between Naruto and Sasuke to battles against threats like Pain and Madara, each fight is an action masterpiece that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\r\nHowever, the true heart of Naruto lies in its character development. Throughout the series, we witness the growth and evolution not only of the protagonist but also of a diverse cast of characters such as Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, each with their own emotional struggles and journeys. In particular, Naruto's transformation from an undisciplined and lonely kid into a full-grown man and hero is inspiring and emotional. His dream of becoming Hokage is not just a personal ambition but a testament to the power of hard work and determination to overcome adversity. His unwavering determination and indomitable spirit serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for viewers, teaching valuable lessons about hard work, friendship, and self-discovery along the way.\n\r\nFurthermore, Naruto is rich in universal themes such as love, loss, redemption, and sacrifice. Moments of humor and camaraderie are balanced with moments of great emotion and drama, creating a truly captivating and multifaceted viewing experience.\n\r\nThe fact that I grew up following Naruto makes this journey even more meaningful to me. As Naruto faced challenges and overcame obstacles, I was also going through my own experiences of growth and learning. Through his struggles and triumphs, I found inspiration and courage to face real-life challenges.\n\r\nIn summary, Naruto is more than just an anime - it's an exciting and inspiring journey that resonates deeply with viewers. If you haven't watched it yet, I encourage you to embark on this life-changing adventure.",

    "\n                I really, really, REALLY tried to like this show. I was a fan of Naruto (the prequel to Shippuden) and I really enjoyed it.... but trying to finish this show was as fun as watching seniors play checkers. SERIOUSLY.\n\r\nStory: Ehhh it was same old Naruto plots and stories. Easily predictable and boring.  Some friend is in a pickle and Naruto goes all emotional to save him even if he met that that guy 2 minutes ago, because he wants to be hokage. Yawn. I saw enough of that in Naruto. Basically, if you watched Naruto and liked it, think of it as the same\n                  \n\nthing... minus the excitement.\n\r\nArt: It was no eye popper, but it surely was no total trash. The action and fighting scenes are still eye candy for actionholics, but other than that, it pretty much is what you'd call standard Naruto animation.\n\r\nSound: The sound is possibly the best part of Naruto Shippuden. The OPs are still great, expected from Naruto, and the endings weren't that shabby either... Shooting Star (the first ending) grew to be one of my most favorite endings of all time.\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters show some development... but in an easily predictable way. Naruto ends up a BIT mature, Sakura grows ladylike... at least for her, and Sasuke grows to be more of a bastard than in Naruto. Some new faces pop up now and then... but they are as memorable as the dust in your belly button.\n\r\nEnjoyment: Now this is where the opinions get diverse. Some Narutoholics will say this is that best thing since Spam and some will say that they watch this show at night just to go to sleep. I'm no Narutoholic so I'd say that the enjoyment for this show is just horrible, but it will be a way for you to waste time if you can get through all the predictable plotlines. \n\r\nOverall: Naruto Shippuden could be, should be, and WILL BE a huge disappointment for Naruto fans who enjoyed the show out of pure action enjoyment. But of course they say that 60% of Naruto watchers end up dying their hair yellow out of love for this show, so it all depends on how you look at Naruto. But overall, Naruto Shippuden isn't something you'd go crazy for. Take my word for it. \r\nOverall:",
    "\n                Tl;dr: This title is a masterpiece, but with the excessive volume and poor quality of the filler episodes, watching the filler destroys any prolonged enjoyment.\n\r\nThis show starts out delivering a 10/10 experience right out of the gate. Its a more mature Naruto with some great villains and a story that keeps on delivering. The anime however falls into the \"we don't have enough content\" category and consistently pushes arc after arc of terrible filler that is by far some of the worst of any show. I don't know why the quality drops so much but it just does. \n\r\nWhen the show is on manga content\n                  \n\nit delivers superb animation with great character and scene design, top notch voice acting and music, and an excellent plot with character development. Where I am now with watching the show (roughly episode 415) nearly 30-40% of the show has been filler and the current story line shows 1 or 2 episodes from the manga then goes off on a filler flashback tangent for 10-20 episodes, then back to 1 episode of actual story, then back to another 10 episodes of filler garbage. Specifically right now, we're on our 3rd (maybe 4th) flashback on the same character. I can't stress that enough, we're on the 4th filler line for one specific character and they don't even try to hide that they have 1) no more ideas for original story, and 2)  they've transplanted Naruto's character and personality into the other character's past. \n\r\nSo basically we're watching Naruto, if Naruto was another character, in the same village. It is a complete degradation of the story back to the original Naruto series before this title grew out of the childish plots and ploys that made that show work, but also makes me never want to return to it again. Awful.\n\r\nI don't have much hope for this pulling any higher than a 6/10 for me at this point. If you had asked me 100 episodes ago if I thought that I would rate this show any less than a 10, I'd tell you that you were out of your mind... I haven't seen a show tank this hard since Bleach.",
    "\n                Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable.\r\nStory in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying\n                  \n\nto save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination.\n\r\nAnimation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the \"characters move so fast\"... .",
    "\n                The series brings some new things, and repeats some old weaknesses to the storytelling.  I'm assuming that anyone reading this has seen at least some of the original series, so please do so if you have not before reading this.\n\r\nStory:  Just as there was a timeskip and gap between series in the anime, the author took a slight break between the two series too.  Which places the studio in an awkward position of when to start releasing the anime series and what pace to set.  Afterall, the reason for almost 100 filler episodes in the original series was to give the\n                  \n\nmanga author time to work.  Even then they are catching up frighteningly fast and are already beginning to \"pepper\" in a couple of filler arcs.  Unlike the old filler arcs however, these segue nicely into the original plot and don't stand out as much as the old ones did.\r\nAs for what happens, it picks up as Naruto returns to Konoha after 2 and a half years of training with Jiraiya.  I will say that I'm somewhat dissappointed with how little he's improved.  Pervy Sage must be a slack-off because the other characters seem to have improved a lot more than Naruto has (even though he's all around stronger, faster, etc.).  He's matured a little, but of course that leaves room for improvement.  As Jiraiya stated before filler hell settled in during the first series, he intended them to return right as Akatsuki would begin to move and Sasuke's life would be in potential danger.  That prediction is dead on as after he is back less than a day Akatsuki begins it's quest to capture all the \"jinchuriki\" (ninja who have tailed beasts within them) starting with Gaara.\r\nYou can go on your own from there.\n\r\nArt: The world seems less...fresh than it did in the first series.  They, so far mind you, have stuck to the seemingly endless woods around Konoha and a brief foray in the lands of the Sand Village (Sonagakure).  The difference in character design  is fascinating, all due to the original author of course.  Both Sai and Yamato are intriguing for their lack of distinguishing features.  While all the other characters are as notable for their looks as their personalities.  Of course all the original young ninja have matured, all hanging around ~15 yo by the looks of things.  The differences are largely subtle and well done.  \n\r\nSound: This is the biggest letdown.  Not because it's poor quality, but because it's always the same 3 tracks playing.  There is no variety in music and the same \"Battle/danger\" music plays all the time.  The variety of music from the first series is gone and that is sad because the original Naruto has an excellent soundtrack.\n\r\nCharacter:  Naruto is much the same, but tempered with maturity in that he is able to understand others (except Sakura of course) much better.  He is still obsessed with rescuing Sasuke, and is still reckless and rash.  He seems especially stagnated in comparison to the others who have all become Chunin and even Jonin.  Naruto does show maturity when he learns that Gaara has not only surpassed him but has achieved his own goal by coming Kazekage of his village (though it's later revealed it was for political reasons).\r\nSakura has changed the most.  One of my fav moments from the new series is how she actually becomes interested in Naruto (noting his physique has matured) but is quickly disuaded by discovering his lack of \"coolness\" (aka bragging about a \"new\" sexy jutsu to Konahamaru and telling her that she looked the same (she's \"filled out\" BTW)).\r\nDue to 9 tailed fox's increased power within Naruto, and the fact that they are lacking Sasuke, Tsunade assigns two former ANBU members to join their squad (Kakashi ends up back in the hospital right away of course).  They are Yamato and Sai.  Yamato is the result of one of Orochimaru's experiments, which gives him the powers of the first Hokage.  These are the power of wood element (he can build a mansion in seconds) and limited control over tailed beasts, namely the nine-tailed fox by using the pendant that Tsunade gave Naruto.  Frequently they play off his amazingly blank face.  Naruto, and the viewers for that matter, find his face kinda eerie at times.  They don't hesitate to have fun with this.  He's very kind-hearted though and looks up to Kakashi, calling him Senpai (implying that he served under him in ANBU.  (note: Yamato is not his real name, but he continues to use it)\r\nSai, is originally planted in the group by Danzo, the leader of ANBU root and Tsunade's political nemesis within Konoha.  Trained not to show any emotion, he eventually begins to respond to Naruto and the others.  He provides a lot of comic relief by trying to interract with the others.\n\r\nEnjoyment:  It's not as groundbreaking as the orignal, but the series continues to be fun.  Naruto continues to grow and mature over the (now 100 episodes) series and is even learning to better use his current jutsus, thanks to Kakashi actually involving himself in Naruto's training for the first time.  The gags continue a lot but now that characters are actually dying (other than enemies or the elderly (3rd Hokage) it's gotten more serious as well.\n\r\nOverall: The series has a long ways to go, and since the author is far from finished it will be interesting how they decide to keep pace.  They are currently on their 2nd filler arc.  The first was somewhat silly, but gave everyone background on Asuma which is very important for reasons I refuse to give away at this time.  The 2nd seems to be explaining where the 3-tails jinchuriki came from so it'll be interesting to see how they handle it.\r\nOf course the original story is very strong and fast paced.  To this date the highlight of the series has definately been when Naruto takes on Orochimaru.  It helps you appreciate just how strong Orochimaru is.\r\nThe battles with the Akatsuki have been fascinating, mostly because they have so few weaknesses and how hard the Konoha ninja have to work to defeat them.",
    "\n                Given the voracity of the backlash against the \"not-so-bad\" rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.\n\r\nSo where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more\n                  \n\nor less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.\n\r\nThe characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke's blandness and Naruto's charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.\n\r\nThe animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.\n\r\nIt is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn't saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto's Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.\n\r\nHow one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn't too much here that I haven't seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom.\n\r\nIn closing, Naruto, while being better than worse without a doubt, doesn't quite succeed in being as mind-blowing as the hype-machine would have you believe.\n\r\nThis anime volleys between a two-star and a four-star feature depending upon your anime viewing mileage and how easily you can stomach an anime so action laden. If you are relatively new to anime and a fan of DragonBall Z and YuYu Hakusho, it is a four-star feature. Otherwise, this is a three-star series at best",
    "\n                Note: Review has been suitably edited to match my views on the anime as of present time. Will have spoilers. You've been warned.\r\n-I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some errors. Please accept my apology.-\n\r\nNaruto or Naruto Shippuuden?\r\nIf I were to compare naruto and naruto shippuuden, somewhere down the line I would still prefer the former. Although I accept naruto shippuden has better fight scenes, the disappointing twists and turns have multiplied considerably too. \n\r\nCharacters:\r\nNaruto shippuuden has an army of fans for a reason, and one of the biggest reason is this - the characters. Almost all types of people will find atleast\n                  \n\none lovable character in this series, not to mention there are so many! In naruto there are no outright good or bad guys. Almost every character is very believable although sometimes they tend to get repetitive (spoiler >> all those \"healed\" by naruto pretty much have the same sob history as him. Gaara, pein..why?)\n\r\nCharacter development:\r\nThe leads:\r\nThe thing I find irritating about the series is that sasuke is hyped too much. (haven't we had enough of mourning for sasuke while the characters grew up?) ..and yet he is nowhere to be seen. I'd prefer if the entire series stops going hush hush about him and actually have him take up proper screen space for once. The \"mystery\" charm is not working anymore, in fact its getting irritating.\r\nIn the recent episodes, naruto's significance has considerably increased which makes me happy because to me it somewhat always felt like naruto as the lead was being sidelined a bit. A character's importance is not entirely calculated by his screen space. He has grown up wonderfully after his recent encounters with akatsuki, and for once something in naruto made me feel all happy like the good ol' naruto series.\r\nSasuke, he seems to be really strong now after training for years under Orochimaru but much can't be said as the anime hasn't progressed so far. The manga is another ball, ofcourse. Although on personal or emotional level (whatever way you like to see it) he still remains the b@st@rd who will not even twitch for a split second before tossing naruto's feelings aside; who along with sakura is still ever so determined to bring him back home. Such level of coldness for someone who loves and cares for you so much is not \"cool\", its outright irritating.\r\nThe third and probably the most criticised one, sakura, is a complete contrast from her old days now. While the heartache of losing sasuke is still there, she's become a gem of a medical ninja AND has the much in/famous montrous strength inherited from Tsunade; which is impressive. I don't mind if she's not in the war zone fighting, as long as she is good in what she's doing which she is, so even though I didn't like sakura initially; I do not completely agree to her being criticized now. I just hope they give her more significant role to play. Also, her relation with naruto has developed considerably and in a good way.\n\r\nThe side sicks:\r\nspoiler >>One thing I find really irritating with this series is that every character you start liking meets an unexpected end, and not in a good way. Sasuke is TEH GOD, naruto is the broken hearted kid in distress and sakura..well she still exists. Not that I have any grudge against sasuke, infact he used to be one of my favourites in naruto series; but I think there are far too many good characters with great potential in the series that are majorly sidelined while sasuke is being hyped to the level that it left some fans irritated. (Again I must go back to the point that if he is so important then don't have almost 100 episodes with pretty much no screen presence of him at all! Talk less and show more is what I want to say, and minus the army of fangirls if at all possible.)\n\r\nAkatsuki: SPOILERZZZZZZ!!\r\nWhat excited me most about naruto shippuudin is akatsuki. What excited me most about the entire naruto universe ever since I came to know something like akatsuki existed is AKATSUKI. When they were finally introduced, I was nearly ready to shed tears of joy. I guess that was one of the very rare fangirlish moment I had in my life as an otaku. But the way it happened made my jaw fall on the floor. With disappointment, that is. They make an awesome character like hidan, and he pretty much (almost) dies with not even one \"proper\" fight. It left me utterly frustated. And I just couldn't understand someone like kakuzu who survived a fight the great you-know-who got his ass handed to him just like that by naruto. Okay, naruto got stronger and all that but still, the transition was a bit too sudden for me to believe. As for sasori I really can't complain because what happened was no surprise (and one thing .. please he did not get owned by sakura. I find it so hard to believe why people keep forgetting that someone who actually knew so much about him was there too!! Defeat was only natural).. but I'd have been really happy if he had made a come back or something. Whatever, illogical demands.. heh.\n\r\nAnime progress:\r\nAnother blooper is the progress of anime. With animes where anime and manga have become quite close, frequent fillers are acceptable and NEEDED. But naruto manga is like..zillion light years away from the anime then what is the need of such slow progress? I dropped naruto at ep 100 due to its slow progress and temporarily switched to other animes. Once it gains its pace, being a narutard I'm; I'll most likely be lured into watching naruto again.\n\n\r\nAnimation:\r\nSomething is wrong with naruto's quality, its not just the same anymore. The anatomy sometimes is horribly wrong .. to the point that you're able to notice it even when something really interesting is going on. The jumping from trees to trees scenes almost always look like people are flying, and some things just don't make sense anymore. Considering that the anime takes its own sweet time in progressing compared to manga, this type of quality is a major setback to fans but if you're a narutard fear not. You'll pretty much still be glued to this anime no matter how bad it gets.\n\r\nSound:\r\nI'm one of those people who don't get bothered a lot by sound unless its so off to the point that its ruining the scene so I pretty much find the sounds okay. The openings and ending except one or two aren't all that great compared to other animes but still fine.\n\r\nThe biggest setback.. fansub: This is not important and perhaps not related.. but while I'm at it why not cover this too?\r\nWe all know dattebayo, if you don't then you probably don't watch naruto and shouldn't be reading this review because its full of spoilers. Anyway, the biggest setback came to me when crunchyroll took up naruto leading dattebayo to drop it. My source of watching HQ naruto was lost because DB won't sub it, crunchyroll won't air it for our country because its licensed here and I won't get to see it because for whatever xyz reasons CR doesn't know, NARUTO IS NOT ON SALE HERE! Shipping from abroad costs more than the actual anime, which is obviously not an option.  And its not just me, a huge chuck of anime fans in my country stopped watching naruto for the same reason after DB dropped it. \n\n\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I think naruto shippuuden is a good anime with outstanding characters, but not-so-good priorities and balance between characters. Neverthless, it still deserves at least one time watch. Its one of the most popular anime of today's time, reviews only matter upto a limit.. don't they?",
    "\n                Tales of perseverance and redemption dominate Naruto: Shippuuden, but the delivery stumbles into the familiar trap of idealistic overkill. Conflicts that should challenge characters morally or strategically often dissolve into speeches about friendship, willpower, or destiny\u2014rendering complex struggles toothless.\n\r\nEvery major villain is eventually revealed to be misunderstood or tragic, stripped of their menace to fit a world where no one is truly evil, just hurt. While the intent might be noble, the execution feels disingenuous.\n\r\nAll episodes were watched\u2014not out of enjoyment, but out of habit. Completionism has its curses, and few shows test that like this one.\n\r\nThe show leans heavily on emotional highs, recycling the\n                  \n\nsame themes until they lose impact. Real nuance rarely survives its determination to turn every story into a morality tale.",
    "\n                Naruto...one of the most popular anime to ever be created, and one of the big players in mainstream shonen anime. Regardless of whether you love Naruto or hate it, you have to admit it did something right -- nothing can get this popular while being very bad.\n\r\nStory -- 9\n\r\nThe story of Naruto is probably the best and worst quality of this anime. It's built around the complex world of ninjas (shinobi) that is very carefully crafted with hundreds of characters, tons of ninja abilities (jutsus), and an immersive system of countries/villages. All this creates an almost surreal realistic effect. The amount of work it takes\n                  \n\nto actually become well versed in all of Naruto-dom is a lot, but anyone that watches the 400+ episodes combined between Naruto and Shippuuden will learn them. So the greatest part of this anime is that it is large, evolving, changing. But the world, can, be at times, almost TOO large. You can have one episode in the middle of Konoha (Village Hidden in the Leaves in the dub) and then suddenly jump to a location far far away, with little pretext. While that's fine and dandy, it's hard to jump from place to place and time to time. Some episodes also are happening at subsequent times with others: randomly making up numbers, but 42 and 43 could happen at the same time in the Naruto world -- just in different places. The world is great, but the method they use to show it can be jumpy and confusing at points to someone that isn't used to it.\n\r\nArt -- 6\n\r\nThe art in Naruto isn't bad. Well, yes it is. Wait, no it's not. Wait, yes it is. And that basically sums up the art in Naruto -- it will be pristine one moment, then trash the next. I remember at one point during one of the ever-so-long filler arcs, the art quality got so bad that you could just see straight lines for people's edges, rather than the often used inventions known as curved lines. But as soon as the story came back into the main story arc, the art suddenly jumped back. I think even the studio that works on Naruto gets tired of the filler, sometimes. Overall, it would be a 7 or 8 normally, but due to the laziness of the studio in some episodes, I'm bumping it down to a 6. \n\n\r\nSound -- 8\n\r\nThe other great thing about popular shows is that they can always have an amazing soundtrack. This is true for both Naruto the original and Shippuuden. The opening, closings, and themes of Naruto are not overly complex, but recognizable and not harsh on the ears. Some memorable themes from both series would have to include \"Blue Bird,\" \"Sadness & Sorrow,\" and \"Sengunbanba.\" Though they are spread out -- most of the openings and closings aren't bad, just not memorable -- there are the occasional few that you will remember and think \"that  music paired up so well.\" At one point, a very emotional instrumental piece -- Sadness & Sorrow -- was played during the funeral of one of the ninja leaders. The somber attitude, good artwork (for once! hooray!) and moody and powerful music allowed that particular episode to stay in people's minds.\n\r\nCharacter -- 7\n\r\nCharacter, character, character. The characters of Naruto are always evolving, changing, etc., etc. But the problem is -- is that when you have such a large world, with a couple hundred characters, the majority of them will get put on the side. So you are introduced to Awesome Character Z, who you love for maybe 10 or 20 episodes. But then they're put to the side, and they just become filler every now and then -- it's hard to include everyone. The main characters' development is nice, to say a lot. If you compare the Naruto at the start of the original series to the Naruto now, a lot has changed. Even more so if you compare it to what has happened in the manga. It basically follows his life from the 12 year old child everyone hates (you know there is one of those kids you hate in your life, don't lie!) to a respectable and caring adult (ish?) person. Of course, he's still the same old perverted, bloody-nosed kid on the inside, but the change in attitude, thinking, and manners is noticeable to say the least. Other characters -- specifically Hinata -- are thrust into a main-supporting role, with small development -- she basically has a crush on him which cripples her, and then she has to confront that and either save herself or Naruto in order to be productive, and stays like this for well, the entire series. These sort of characters (see: Temari, Gaara, Hinata, Neji, etc.) are basically only used for the advancement of the main characters (see: Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Sai, etc.).\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 7\n\r\nOkay. Filler. Filler. Filler. OMG Awesome episode-! No, wait, filler.\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Naruto is spliced up -- the fillers are generally boring and only put out to keep the massive drones that support Naruto appeased -- but I have to admit, there are some pretty awesome fight sequences and battle scenes. If you are one of the people who likes to skip over / breeze through filler, then you will get a greater enjoyment out of Naruto Shippuuden as a whole. It seems as of late like they've been stretching each of the episodes out a little more than needed (as if to give the manga an already larger head start which it doesn't need), but I'm willing to chalk that up as a decision to explain what's happening fully. At the moment, a lot of complicated drama and plots are coming together and unfolding, so the pace doesn't need to be as fast as in the manga. Regardless, counting filler, enjoyment is about a 7. Without it, it would be an 8 or 8.5; just filler would be a 4.5ish. So as a whole, it's a 7.\n\r\nOverall - 7.5\r\nTLDR:\r\nYou can't really put \"halfs\" on these reviews, so I decided to be generous and give it that extra .5. Out of the \"kings\" of shonen mainstream anime, Naruto definitely is not the worst (see: One Piece, Bleach) but not as refined as the best (see:Fullmetal Alchemist). It has very strong story and sound elements, and can have both very crappy and very well made art. The character development for main characters is fantastic -- just not so much for the static and supporting characters. The enjoyment value is high when it's following the manga and not in filler -- it is dismal when it is in filler, though. Overall, it's a decent series. Maybe not watching 400 episodes worth if you want to catch up / are starting new, but not a bad series by any means.",
    "\n                I started watching Naruto the wrong way. \n\n\r\nThe first thing I knew about Naruto was his battle with Pain. Then after that, I began watching Jiraiya's fight with Nagato. Sakura and Granny Chiyo's battle with Sasori. The Third Hokage's death. And so on... I missed a lot of episode, nevertheless, I knew I should begin with the first episode not in Shippuuden but in the original Naruto itself. \n\r\nBut nooo. I was so stubborn so I began to read the manga first. Ever since I heard that Naruto has ended, I was itching to read its manga for good. And I did. A week later,\n                  \n\nI found myself crying and inspired. I regret not paying attention to such an amazing manga. \n\r\nSTORY :\n\r\nSome would say I'm exaggerating, but for me, Naruto is what I can proudly say a \"masterpiece\". I love Naruto so much it pains my kokoro. Any month now, or maybe a year, Shippuuden will end like a flash. Fillers may make this masterpiece a junk but I assure you, some fillers are worth a shot. If you hate it, then don't watch it. The pacing will still be the same. Naruto will remain the same. I may not be a super Naruto fanatic, I can't call myself that yet. Naruto may not be my childhood favorite but it is my inspiration. The heck with Naruto-more-then-a-decade fans. I, too, has Naruto inside me. \n\r\nNinjustu. Gengutsu. Taijutsu. Senjutsu. Fuinjutsu. There are so many justu to elaborate with but that makes this anime special. Over the past decade, I hear many jutsu throughout my community. I remember how I used to play games on my friends ps3. Naruto here, Naruto there. Even now, when I attend cosplay events, Naruto is still popular. I always ask myself why. Why is Naruto so popular? Is the anime even this good? Why is Sasuke such a news word in the society? Now I know why : it's because you can never change time. You can never change hearts. You can never change memories. \n\r\nNaruto has its own place in the anime industry. As well as any other anime out there. Even if A LOT are already tired of fillers and unending battles, this anime will never waver. Who could ever forget Naruto famous \"I'll become a Hokage\" quote? I'm sure that I won't. (10/10)\n\r\nCHARACTER :\n\r\nAhhh. This is what I love the most in this anime. So let's start with Naruto Uzumaki. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki. The prophecy child. Who would not love Naruto, anyway? He may be a loser, a brat, a stupid shinobi, but who would have thought that he could can the whole shinobi world? Naruto's development started when people hated him more and more as he grows up. And later did he blossom when a person finally acknowledge him. He is not just the nine tails jinchuriki. He is Naruto Uzumaki. And he will become a hokage. A man full of words is better than a man who doesn't recognize his worth. \n\r\nAnd there's come Sasuke. Sasuke Uchiha, the avenger (coughs). Kidding! I honestly hated Sasuke at first. Unlike Naruto, he only wants vengeance. He locks his self in his own wicked world. He wanted to become strong to kill the person who attacked his village, his parents, his everything. I know it must have been painful to witness your beloved killed also by your beloved, but putting everything aside  for vengeance? Alright, that's pretty much okay. No one could ever stop you anyway. And if it wasn't for Sasuke the avenger, things would not end up the way it is in the end. Everyone has a purpose in life. Despite of everything he did, I'd still want him back. He's home is Konohagakure after all.\n\r\nAnd as for Sakura. Oh, I love her development. From a weak and fragile girl to a strong and powerful woman indeed. I never hated her, really. She has her own issues and I respected that. She love Sasuke (who doesn't?) so much that she was willing to do everything for him.  Love is a battle, and so she took her own path by becoming a shinobi that can stand by herself. She is a character that has an open development. Watch the anime and you'll see how she strive everything for her to be acknowledge the same way the rest of the Team 7 were.\n\r\nThere are many more characters to praise. Everyone changed for the better. They had their own pain, happiness, beliefs. Thank you specially for Naruto's Will of Fire for leading the shinobi world. Everything was worth it. (10/10)\n\r\nART AND SOUND :\n\r\nI am not really good when it comes to analyzing the art style but from what I saw, it was an okay for me. There are some fights that I was expecting a lot of animations but thank you for the sound and effects my feels stays the same. I love how the sound can be so perfect from time to time. There are many soundtracks too that I would love to listen over and over. The background music is always fitting with the atmosphere. It makes me cry, ya know!!! I just hope the animation will be amazing in the last part of the series. (MadaraxGuy / SasukexNaruto fight pls)\n\r\nENJOYMENT :\n\r\nI cried. I laughed. I felt the pain and the hopes of many shinobi in this anime. And I wouldn't have asked for more.  Thank you for the roller coaster ride, Naruto. Thank you for teaching me not to give up. Thank you for the comfort and love that I haven't realized all these years. And oh, thank you Kishimoto Sensei for creating Naruto. I love you so much, thank you thank you thank you!!! Words will never be enough for inspiring me to believe in myself. I will never give up. No matter how hard life may be, I'll always remember Naruto's will of never giving up. \n\r\n\"And my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage! Then the whole village will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Somebody important!\" - Naruto Uzumaki\n\n\n\r\nThis anime is worth a shot. Try watching every episode and refrain from skipping fillers. Some of it may be very important, ya know! \n\r\n\"A masterpiece will never be considered as a flawless creation nor idea. Everything and everyone has its own flaws and mistakes. Nevertheless, a masterpiece is considered to be acknowledge and not to be judge by others.\"\n\r\nAnd that is what I learned from watching this amazing anime. May others find their own inspiration in you, Naruto.",
    "\n                It's been nearly 4 years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly 8 since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... 3 months later and 400+ episodes finished and here I am.\n\r\nI'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if I\n                  \n\nwas watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a 500+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong.\n\r\nThere was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters.  Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness. \n\r\nI'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself. \n\r\nWhat started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for 10+ yrs and almost 1K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.",
    "\n                \"Naruto is Naruto\" and though Ive only seen the first 5-8 episodes I would still keep watching it. The only thing you should expect from naruto is a great fight scene and a great  story. I didn't think it was that different from the older naruto. The characters do however act differently, such as naruto. Ive seen the new guy and all that. Instead of comparing this to the old naruto, you should be looking forward as things will change when he gets old and you should expect that from a series that continues as the characters get older. Things have definitely got more\n                  \n\nserious but the fighting is way better. I stopped watching old naruto at episode 120 because it became to childish for me(even though I really love the series). This is why I like shippuuden. Because they have taken a more serious approach with the series. So naruto fans Id high recommended this to you: )",
    "\n                 Plot:\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is the continuation of the original animated TV series Naruto.The story revolves around an older and slightly more matured Uzumaki Naruto and his quest to save his friend Uchiha Sasuke from the grips of the snake-like Shinobi, Orochimaru. After 2 and a half years Naruto finally returns to his village of Konoha, and sets about putting his ambitions to work, though it will not be easy, as He has amassed a few (more dangerous) enemies, in the likes of the shinobi organization; Akatsuki.\n\n\r\nNaruto is an extremely popular Anime in Japan and even across the world.. The setting and the characters of this\n                  \n\nanime will make you want to live in this world.. The story is good but not unique, the art look is outstanding, so overall I'll rank it 9/10..",
    "\n                15 years.\n\r\nIt's the reason I have for this to steal my heart despite its flaws. The story of a loser who changes the world. Positive symbolism is through everything, characters serving as general explanations for wrong human behaviours and the complexity of life are all stirred in a thick and massive stew of characters, affiliation, thoughts, perspectives, feelings...Naruto is a huge world with lots of stories and depth. And of course with so much time you can tell so much but this also means that the franchise targeted a few stages of teenage years to create something bigger than the story itself by adding the\n                  \n\nelement of time to the viewing experience. Some people will call it undeserved hype, but they also probably masturbate to stuff like Aoi Bungaku, Steins:Gate or animes that did not get a second season but oh boy was it going somewhere. \n\r\nThis anime is timeless, Naruto and Miyazaki are immortal and if we would be fair enough to only grant access at an hypothetical bar in upscale London to animes that were able to obtain such status, the bar would never be short on staff.\n\r\nHaku should of gotten more screen time, Jiraiya's death was needed but very dramatic, sasuke is ultimately kind of a douche, sakura should of been stronger and knowing that there is traffic on narutopedia is somewhat cool.",
    "\n                Naruto series is the reason why i started watching anime and Shippuden is honestly one of the best anime i've ever watched,or simply,the best. i kinda have a perfect life, unlike naruto, but i can relate to him at some point. i'm touched by how naruto is determined to work hard so that the village would acknowledge him as someone who is worth to be watched. Despite his lonely and sad childhood, he didn't let those things to overcome him to become dark, but instead, he let those sad memories as a fuel to drive him to become a better person. i love everything about\n                  \n\nhis character, his annoying yet funny stupidity, his unconditional love towards his friends and comrades, his endless hard work even when everything around him comes crashing down. most importantly, i love  how he use his past to understand others instead of judging them. being as strong as he is but still is humble enough to lower himself for something he believes in is just pure inspiration. from being a loner to being around many loyal friends and comrades and have the trust of all shinobi in other hidden villages. he will make an amazing hokage. this anime might be fictional, but i value this anime so much it has more meaning and depth than that. im very sad that this anime is coming to an end, but this anime and the messages it contains will forever live. \n\r\nthank you Kishimoto for this amazing journey you've shared with me and the rest of naruto's fans. Arigato",
    "\n                The show gave me much enjoyment for many years with the amazing fight scenes and great story. \n\r\nHowever the animation has gone down the toilet amazingly fast. There are very select fight scenes that occur every year or so that are well done, but the corners they've been cutting to keep animation budgets at a minimum is not well hidden. Half of the episodes are now filler that are completely intrusive and have no place in the show. The episodes are now long and drawn out with flash backs or long pauses.\n\r\nI absolutely love the manga and it tears me apart to see how\n                  \n\nthey've animated it. The animations are now just borderline stillframes.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden seriously started off very strong for me. After that preview episode with Naruto and Sasuke facing off again I got so much hype. I got so excited as I thought this was gonna be so awesome. Like the be all to end all clash of epicness. The first two arcs were pretty damn good I'll give that. There were some tearful moments when a few of you're favorite characters were seen dying. I thought that was a good way to really get you hooked. But by the end of it Naruto Shippuuden felt like such an after thought. \n\r\nNow for me the original\n                  \n\nanime got so many things right. The character development was big for some of the characters, The action was enjoyable and of course it really kept you excited for things. My only real complaints were that the filler lasted forever sometimes and it felt like it was taking too much inspiration from a lot of anime. As they were targeting the right audience for both kids and adults. It had just enough humor and serious action for all the fans.\n\r\nBut let me get to why Shippuden basically fails on some degree. The first point is that Naruto himself seriously lacks character development. I mean sure he does learn a new jutsu here and there. But he lacks his own sense of humor compared to the original series. It's also very hard to feel for him most of the time. The only time I ever really felt any sympathy for Naruto was when someone special to him died. I'm not going to spoil any of the big moments as if you are curious you can check it out for yourself. The rest of the other character development is take it or leave it. You'll have to decide for yourself which characters you love the most.\n\r\nThe storyline this time around is nothing to write home about. While I will give it something for trying to connect everything more. Also the fact that it tries to be very mature in some parts. Though its something I can't get into in general. The fights are also really awesome to some degree. It has a lot of amazing moments and it was really good. But I seriously began to lose interest after some filler arcs and when I was two or three arcs into Shippuuden. The artwork however is very good in general. I think the anime looks very sharp overall and the presentation is quite good to me. The music is great once again. With traditional Japanese music and some epic orchestra music thrown in. The presentation might be one of Shipuuden's strong points.\n\r\nOverall Naruto Shippuden is something that has dissapointed me. I did really enjoy the fights to some degree. The music and artwork is also quite good as well. But to a degree this has dissapointed me so much. The emotion also feels very lacking and you could really careless about the story. But I find it very difficult to really enjoy Naruto Shippuuden in general.",
    "\n                Alright, Naruto Shippuuden itself is badass. You just can't help but to love certain characters, the action is great and the emotion is there but most of the times you either won't care or you won't even notice. The music in the anime is fantastic and really gives that ninja/shinobi feel, especially due to iconic Japanese instruments such as the shamisen. Some tracks may be overused a bit, but it's not bothering in general. It just makes certain moments predictable.\n\r\nAlthough I love the story, I can't stand the fillers and flashbacks. They use flashbacks and fillers on the most inappropriate moments. \r\nLet me give you\n                  \n\nan example: In the middle of the final battle they will throw 12 fillers in your face.  After that they continue with the final battle for one episode, and while a character's performing a major act for the story.. he decides to have a flashback, continued with another flashback episode. Seriously, it's ridiculous. It totally ruins the atmosphere, excitement and enjoyment. They also repeat a lot of scenes from flashbacks, heck I wouldn't be surprised if some episodes are the exact same, but with the scenes in another order.\n\r\nThis is why I rate Naruto Shippuuden a 6 overall. I find myself saying \"AH NO\" way too often on the first frame of the \"Next time on Naruto Shippuuden!\" at the end of every episode, which isn't a good sign. Will they make it better with the episodes to come? Time will tell.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden. This show is both loved and demised. I personally like the series, it's good and nice to watch, nothing overly amazing and not that much overly crap shoot stuff I hate. (OH WAIT)\n\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story in Shippuden is nice, all wrapped up with a bow. At times it is serious and somewhat thrilling to watch, and other times you're blowing bubbles in your chocolate milk as people talk about stuff for over a minute. The overall plot in the story stays the same almost the entire way through, Naruto wants to \"save\" Sasuke, somehow stop Akatsuki, and be recognized by the village. The\n                  \n\nlast one happens after Pain is defeated, and none of the other ones have happened so far so, more sludging through. (WEEEE)\n\r\nArt: 6\r\nThe animation changes so much throughout this series, in such varying degrees and yes, I know that the studio has a budget, but when you use the same flashback over five times, barely even ****ing shade anything, keep characters frozen still while they're talking, and try to pass off people staring at each other for a FULL MINUTE as part of the show, you start to wonder how Studio Pierrot is even doing. But the show does have nice, fantastic animation. It's just not as frequent. Also, some of the best animation and shading I've seen in this show have been during fights and the OPs and EDs, and some other places throughout.\n\r\nSound: 7\r\nThis is a another reason why people hate Shippuden. I'm not talking about the voice actors, they're great, I'm talking about the music. Sure, there are nice tracks throughout the series, some are beautiful, others I could somewhat jam to. But when I think that you've played that same stupid \"OMG SUSPENSE SH*T IS HAPPENING\" track for the hundredth time, I feel like face-desking. So many tracks are overly repeated to the point where you feel like you could play them if someone gave you the instrument they were playing the music with somewhat mediocrity. I'm also including OPs and EDs. A lot of the openings and endings sound great, like \"Cascade\" and \"FLAME\" Others sound, well, annoying, overly produced, and bleh. BLEH. Like the sh*tfest which is \"Totsugeki Rock\". Just, ewwww.\n\r\nCharacters: 7\r\nThe characters in this show are nice. Sure, some of them are kinda tropey, but most them have something unique. Naruto seems to go through lots of pressure, CAUSE GUESS WHAT? OP PEOPLE WANNA MURDER YA! So he gets to experience and grow through that. Sakura is still romanticizing with hopes of being with Sasuke, and I can be harsh here, but I can't. I'm a hopeless romantic too. *sigh* She is tough though, and doesn't take no sh*t. Sai is shown to have had a bond with a person who was like a brother to him, and they then had to fight to the death, (**** you Danzou) and it had feels. Sasuke is a stupid hormone controlled idiot who wants to destroy the thing his brother protected, and \"build a new nation\". Can I call him stupid again?The other characters are fine, but a lot of them you couldn't really feel for since you didn't know that much about them.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\r\nFILLER. FILLER. FFFFFIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I\"M HERE WANTING TO SEE A NEW EPISODE OF CANON, I SAY, CANON SHIPPUDEN, AND PIERROT THROWS A ****ING FILLER EPISODE OUT. AND IT\"S AT SUCH UNNECESSARY MOMENTS TOO, LIKE A BATTLE JUST ENDED, EMOTIONAL SH*T HAPPENED, AND YOU THEN GET FILLER, YOU THEN FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TWO TO THREE WEEKS AGO, AND YOU DON'T GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT THE **** HAPPENED, OR YOU JUST FORGET ENTIRELY IF THE FILLER RUNS FOR EIGHTY YEARS. AND SOMETIMES THE FILLER SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO THE MAIN STORY AND IT'S BULLSH*T. THE PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST BINGE THIS SHOW AND SKIP FILLERS I WISH I COULD PUNCH. *heavy breathing* The fights are nice as well, like GAI V MADARA. IT WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT, BUT IT WAS STILL AWESOME.\n\r\nOverall: 7\r\nShippuden is an average anime. It's ruined by filler that isn't even interesting or good in the first place, constant reused flashbacks that taint the whole entire series, and the animation at times can be atrocious. (See Pain V Naruto, or ALL THE STILL SHOTS EVER SEEN) The fights can be fun, emotional, or awesome. The main story is nice, but falters at times. The sound can be the most annoying thing of the show at times, but can also be charming or pleasant. This show has over 400 episodes. If you are a person who likes 13 episode anime, then this series is going to be tough on you. If you don't like shonen, then stay away. If you're expecting romance, there ain't a lot of it, I gotta tell ya. There's only around four major moments out of over 400 episodes. If you want awesome action stuff, then this show may fit to your tastes.",
    "\n                The number one knucklehead ninja is...still here! His training seemed to get him no where maturity wise or skill wise. He has used the same jutsu, the same yelling tactics to throw his enemy off(?) And the same &quot;I'm hokage&quot;, &quot;I'll save you!&quot;, or &quot;My childhood sucked!&quot; Lines. He hasn't grown or learned a thing. I would think he would stop endangering his team, being disrespectful to his senior officers, and trying to solo things rather than listening to the plans. When they were younger it was acceptable, it was even funny at times, but not now. Any scene with naruto I skip immediately. It\n                  \n\nis either screaming, crying, or &quot;kage bunshin no jutsu&quot;. \n\r\nSakura and others are shown to have grown and learned many things through their training. Sakura has become way cooler than she ever was in Naruto, as well as tenten and others using newer styles of fighting from Naruto. I guess we will never see a change in the main character. I really did enjoy Naruto, but maybe I expected too much from Shippuden, or to much of a change maybe? Either way, I feel like now that they are older and with the main character still acting like this, makes the whole shinobi thing, along with all of the danger and life-threatening fighting look like a complete joke to the theme. As well as they are afraid of killing people off in my opinion, having them win against people who are said to be the greatest in the world. Making the characters older really did nothing, it is meant for the same audience that watched Naruto, and who didn't want any change or development.\n\r\nThe story is pretty good though, I enjoy learning about the plot development as it goes by and want to see more about Akatsuki's plans. The story with sasuke and orochimaru is good also, as I feel it will all be tied together at some point in the anime and we should see some good fight scenes (I hope).\n\r\nThat's about it, it's not that I hate it, but I was severely disappointed by it in a lot of ways.",
    "\n                ROAD BLOCKS IN PLOT WRITING AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM: SPECIAL ABRIDGED KISHIMOTO EDITION\n\r\n1)\tI created a unique main character with a great ambition, how do I make this character instantly likable?\n\r\nKishi says: I\u2019ll let you in on a trade secret: \u201cTragic motherfuckin\u2019 back-story.\u201d  You want your character\u2019s childhood to be filled with angst, bullying, depression, thoughts of suicide, and maybe molestation (save this one for an easy shock reveal later on!). Remember, your character in present-day needs to be NOTHING like his childhood self for he will have overcome that shitty past with the almighty \u201cSTRONG RESOLUTION\u201d. It\u2019s all about the compare and contrast.\n                  \n\n\u201cGood people deserve good futures\u201d, readers love this.\n\r\n2)\tEvery protagonist needs an antagonist. What should a good antagonist be like?\n\r\nKishi says: Polar opposite. A perfect antithesis of the main character. Have him bent onto a totally evil goal, like say... oh I donno... revenge? Also, make him sexy and make him mysterious. Chicks love that shit. And don\u2019t you fucking forget about that tragic back-story!\n\r\n3)\tShould my female characters be important and useful?\n\r\nKishi says: No.\n\r\n--- Many pages of wisdom later ---\n\r\n56) I have followed your sage advice. My protagonist has forgotten his original ambition and is now stricken with intense homolust for the antagonist. As per your suggestions, I have also went through many INTENSE training arcs: a new ability training arc, a training arc to prepare for a training arc, another new ability training arc, a timeskip training arc, a training arc after a training arc to control the new power gained from a previous training arc, and finally, super saiyan training on Namek.\n\r\nKishi says: *wipes tear* This is beautiful. I couldn\u2019t have done better myself.\n\r\n---A few pages of growing regret later---\n\r\n72) Since that timeskip you recommended, I feel my protagonist has become severely overpowered, rendering everyone, but his lover, primitive in comparison. It seems that he has already long surpassed his original goal and achieving it now won\u2019t amount to any sort of satisfaction. What hurts the most however, is seeing my fans clinging onto the hope that the plot would carry on, only to be repeatedly swindled with more pointless drivel. Should I bring my manga to a quick close with an epic fight against a greater evil?\n\r\nKishi mutters: Don\u2019t be asinine. Now is the perfect time for another flashback.\n\n\r\n[After many complaints, the book has now been renamed to \u201cWORDS OF ADVICE FROM MASASHI KISHIMOTO: EXPERT TROLL AND MILKER OF DRIED TITS.\u201d]",
    "\n                I just want to start this review by saying that I love this series and I have my reasons, and while I will try to be as objective as possible, I am a fan (this should be known). \n\r\nStory: One of the benefits of such a long story like Naruto is that it truly feels epic. When you finish the series, you feel like you have been through it all with these characters. The story is character-driven as you see our main protagonist, Naruto, and the difficult journey that he experiences throughout his life. This series is quite a bit darker than the original and\n                  \n\nvery mature. This works in this series benefit as its a seriousness that is needed for many of the key moments in the show. It spans through various story arcs that will always have there fair share of intense and \"edge of your seat\" moments. I want to note that there are many times where you will find yourself freaking out due to a particular storyline or amazing moment. \n\r\nArt: This is my lowest grade as the animation can be all over the place. However when it really counts, this series knocks it out of the park with its animation. Some important episodes in the story will literally look like series of high-quality desktop wallpapers flashing in front of your face (no joke, it looks that good sometimes). The fight scenes in this show are probably among the very best anime has to offer. They are visual spectacles and fights with key villains are a whole other level of amazing. It can look slightly weird at times but nothing that will stop you from watching the show or lessen your enjoyment of what you are watching. \n\r\nSound: The openings and endings are all incredible in their own right, with a wide span of music genres (rock songs to love songs). Some soundtracks like Konoha Peace and Experienced Many Battles will literally invigorate you with so much emotion (its crazy). I will say that not all the tracks are perfect but they do their job. \n\r\nCharacter: I can't even describe how good the characters are in Naruto because you just have to see for yourself. I think you can attribute this to how good the Chunin Exam arch was in the original Naruto, but in this series they are just more fleshed out and deepened. You will literally see characters that you may hate at first but end up loving a couple episodes later. The main character, Naruto, is extremely well done and you can't help but like him. The other main character, Sasuke, is equally well-written. The rivalry between the two characters is really something that this series nailed. \n\r\nEnjoyment: This review really can't do this show justice or express my love for the series as a whole. There is a reason Naruto is as popular as it is, and its because it has touched so many people around the world. While there were some bumps along the way, it was worth it. \n\r\nOverall: 10-One of the best anime created",
    "\n                I've been watching Naruto for a very long time. I've read the entire Manga and completed Naruto (Part 1) I've also seen a few of the movies and all the ova's and specials. \n\r\nThe story is utter garbage. It's dragged out and supplemented with horribly written filler arcs. The pacing is painfully slow and unnecessary. The battles are relatively interesting but there is too much needless talk and deliberation. \n\r\nThe art/animation is inconsistent and changes from episode to episode. It's usually very poorly done and while this might be good for saving money and time. Naruto is one of the most heavily marketed Anime in\n                  \n\nthe world, it should have enough funds to pay for decent Animation.\n\r\nThe characters are the best thing about this series. My personal favourites being Madara, Sasuke, Itachi, Orochimaru, Naruto, Kakashi, Hinata and Jiraiya. These characters are pretty deep and deal with their own struggles. \n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. Good OP and ED's.\n\r\nIt's enjoyable to watch but people need to stop rating it so highly. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect and it's pretty damn overrated but it does provide me with lots of entertainment and I'm still watching after 399 episodes... I like this series but lets not pretend its as great as the classics. \n\r\nStory - 6\r\nArt - 5\r\nSound - 8\r\nCharacter - 7\r\nEnjoyment - 7 \r\nOverall - 7",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden is like Star Wars the Disney Sequels - a whole lot of retconning, fan service and bull crap. It's one of those anime continuations or endings that were better off not happening at all. The problem is the story, not the anime, the animation quality or manga, the story is the main culprit.\n\r\nAs it continues off from how Naruto ended, the story starts off full of hope, energy, a lot of new adventures, but just like One Piece Post Time Skip, it just should have not existed at all. Just to see the story ending and the price being the whole story turn\n                  \n\ninto garbage is a price way too high for anyone to pay.\n\r\nThe way the story goes in Shippuuden and how it is explained the origin of Ninjutsu is also too far-fetched and not a satisfying conclusion. There is a lot of going back and forth in the series, a lot of nothing happening for hundreds of episodes, meaning literally years passing with nothing of significance happening. Then there are a lot of useless side-characters from other ninja villages being introduced, each one gets their own flashback to explain their motivation, again wasting at least 30-40 episodes for absolutely no reason.\n\r\nA lot of the time is Naruto acting all strong and mature and Sasuke playing emo once again with some new followers buying his crap. At the end there is a great culmination, combined with dead characters being brought to life and useless characters being killed off like Portgas D. Ace in One Piece just to create a fake feeling of how dark and serious stuff are (which isn't the case), then comes the ending filled with even more retconning and fan service and the series ends. \n\r\nI was glad when it ended, not because I was happy with how it ended, but with the fact that it's over, so I don't have to put up with this trash ever again. The original Naruto series is far superior and it should have never been continued into Shippuuden if it was going to be the garbage it was. This is further emphasized in the series Boruto, which is literally 70% fan service and 30% riding on the old story's fame hoping to keep this garbage afloat. After that I won't be surprised if there is a series about Boruto's grandchildren, and some people will even watch that too.",
    "\n                First of all i would like to pin-point a few things.I have watched all the known mainstream animes that many of us used to watch all these years. Bleach -One piece-Fairy tail( this is kinda a  new one comparison to the others) and i must sayNaruto is by far the best on all its aspects.\n\r\nPeople hating  this anime where they havent even watched it is wierd \n\r\nStory 10-----This is one of the deepest animes i have seen. There are about 50-60 characters in this anime that all have their own stories which drag-on and they have their on impact  in the flow\n                  \n\nof the anime.Putting together a solid story with all these characters and the actual story of the anime is something beyond difficult.\r\nThe clans, the villages, the bijuus, the skills, all the chakra explanation and the battle system.Naruto-Naruto Shippuuden its a world of its own running in a perfect flow.\r\nWho would epect Obito would be alive after the accident, a story that took palce like 500 episodes ago-Naruto shippuuden does that, its not like the other animes that every episode erases its past and starts a new story , its a well-built story  with almost non-glitches\n\r\nSound 10-- 10 is too litle for the most succesfull anime in terms of soundtracks and music. Yashuharu Takanashi has done it again(and Toshio Masuda of course) all the tracks are masterpieces, no wonder why some of the tracks are of world fame and used  for other rasons aswell\n\r\nArt 9-- Very much improved from its prodeccor Naruto-not eprfect though\n\n\r\nCharacter 10---Who didint like that clumpsy loud voice kid at the first part of this anime...Naruto and the others have grown in Shippuuden but in a great way. Naruto has grown as much as he should be and changed as much as he should be.He is not a complitely different person  neither the others, but they all have added new aspects i their characters matching the years difference from Naruto.\n\n\r\nOverall 10- Seriously Naruto Shippuuden is indeed a famous (maybe?)mainstream anime?. So what?? That doesnt make it  bad.Its a high quality anime , one of the best that ever have been aired with very deep story, best music ever made, quite good art and amazing characters. Highly recommend it to everyone(MANDATORY u have watched Naruto first)",
    "\n                My Thoughts on the Ending of Naruto\n\r\nFirst thing first. I will miss Naruto like no other. I first came into contact with Naruto way back in the 7th grade of middle school when it used to air in English on Toonami. It was love at first sight. The date was September 10th, 2005. I eagerly awaited each week for new episodes, and Naruto never disappointed, even on its worst episode. Fast forward 9 years later, and I'm still eagerly awaiting each new episode every week, even though I have already finished the events of the manga. Critics of Naruto say that the anime/ manga has\n                  \n\ngone on for way too long and that it should have ended earlier; it's no longer good. I can't deny that Naruto has a ton of plot holes, but even so, the author has given me something to consistently look forward to for 9 years. How many anime series can you say have done something like that for you? \n\r\nMoreover, my interest in Naruto is not solely tied to the plot. To this day, I've bought 12 Naruto games and counting. I love the Naruto universe. I love the characters. I love the powers. I love the action. I love the voice actors. All of the Naruto games I own do an amazing job at recreating the characters from the series and letting you feel as though you are the character. When I choose Sasuke in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, I feel like I become Sasuke. All of his powers from the show, I can command at the tips of my fingers. I'm the one using the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu, and I'm the one unleashing Susanoo. As a result, the joy I get from being my favorite characters in these games heightens the amount of pleasure I take away from the series itself. \n\r\nIt's been a couple weeks since Naruto ended, and it's still hard to believe it's over. When I read the final chapter, I honestly didn't want to turn the pages. Seeing all of the characters that started off at 12 years old become adults, get married, and have kids, really got believing that it is in fact over--the end of a generation. I was 12 years old myself when I began watching Naruto, now I'm 21. In a way, I feel as though I've grown up with these characters and that my youth is also approaching it's end soon. In the coming years, I'm not sure if I will ever experience an anime that has done what Naruto has done for me ever again. I'm really sad that my journey with Naruto is rapidly approaching it's end, but I'm also thankful for these past 9 years. Arigatou gozaimasu, Masashi Kishimoto.",
    "\n                For all those complaining about the fillers.....If you truly love Naruto, Enjoy the ride while it lasts. And I have to say, this anime was what got me into other anime.The overall opening's and ending's of Naruto was excellent.....along with it's various other soundtracks that make sure to hit you right in the feels. The many character's in the story also add to the excitement of the story and each character's various back story's are well potrayed and conveyed as the stroy continues.\n\r\nAnd well i personally love this anime because this anime really did teach me a lot, from when i was very young and\n                  \n\nit still continues to do a fine job at it.",
    "\n                So now that the manga has ended its serialization and the anime still continues to spew endless filler for no reason other than to milk as much money as possible, I am writing a review to explain to you why Naruto: Shippuden was a promising anime that went downhill since the first episode.\n\r\nThe story of Naruto is an interesting and unique one. Its something that hasn't been told too often and it has a great setting. But the anime does a very poor job of executing it. There are a few canon episodes, then a plethora of fillers appear out of nowhere, so that when\n                  \n\nthe canon story continues from where it left off, I have somewhat lost my hype on what was happening before the filler. This is even more prominent towards the end of the series, which is where there's supposed to be excitement above all else. The fillers themselves are so bad they ruin the characters' personalities to some extent.The canon episodes are dragged on by the same flashbacks so many times you'll start feeling sleepy. The characters' backstories, especially Naruto's, are shown so many times, you won't even feel sentimental anymore. There were some great story arcs like the Pain arc, but the rest all drag on and on.\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Naruto has some of the best characters in anime, hands down. Protagonists like Naruto, Shikamaru, Kiba etc and antagonists like Itachi, Nagato, Madara are some of the best ever in anime history. But I feel that as the series progresses, the series starts focusing too much on Naruto and Sasuke and leaves out interesting supporting characters. Even the notoriously bad guys are somehow turned into good guys through some bullshit backstory so that they MUST turn good before they die, even evil-F*CKING-Madara. so the series kinda ruins the characters it brought up, though I wouldn't say they are bad.\n\r\nThe animation too goes downhill since the beginning, and this is one of the worst aspects of the show. Too many still images, too many flashbacks, too long recaps are all there to increase the runtimes and save up some budget. There were some arcs that were decently animated, but others are sloppy and still to the point I sometimes thought my computer froze.\n\r\nThe soundtrack has a great Ninja-esque felling to it, and it unique and in most instances, pretty catchy. Most of the opening songs are great while the endings are average (I guess). The voice acting is done greatly, as one would expect of anime (lol). The dub, of course, is terrible.WATCH THE CAPTIONS!!!!!\n\r\nOverall, Naruto is good if you ignore the plethora of fillers, the sloppy animation and the terrible dragging on of its episodes, but that just can't be ignore can they?",
    "\n                After a fascinating Naruto series it returns and to my great enjoyment better than ever! I admit I was saddened to see alot of fillers but i guess every story needs a good backround. It was exciting plot and the intros are the best in any anime series.

    "\n                Naruto returns completely different, yet unchanged; yaoi fangirls, filler, and cliche friendship speeches still ruin it for the most part.\n\n\r\nShippuuden and the original naruto are by far the most overrated anime since Gundam Wing. I read the manga up to where it is now, and I can see how it got there, but how the anime maintains fans still amazes me. The fans are classified as \"Narutards\" to the public, due to its overwhelming popularity.\n\r\nThey provide 20 or 40 episodes of filler after 20 slow plot episodes, and it's just not funny at this point. I already stopped watching it an entirely moved back to\n                  \n\nthe manga. The manga still manages to keep me interested, but the anime is dead to me. I loved shippuuden until the filler started getting ridiculous. I don't know what those guys in the anime industry are doing, but it's screwed up how they love to send their ratings plummeting into the ground so often. \n\r\nOriginally, Shippuuden was an anime that had everything; tons of suspense, meaningful death scenes, and touching moments, but now it's just another anime about some grown man that acts like a kid chasing after a homicidal maniac that used to be a \"Friend\" of his.\n\r\nDo I need to say anything else to get the point across that shipuuden is only good for so long?",
    "\n                A good anime, like any piece of art, isn't judged only by it's art style, characters and story. It also heavily relies on the production, fan base and various other factors.\r\nWhile this anime started out well enough it had completely degraded itself with almost 45% of the episodes being fillers. As a fan I get totally engrossed in the plot and when the production decides to milk the fans for more views this becomes a stab in the back of dedicated viewers.\n\r\nFor 10 years I've watched this anime and at long last after all said and done all I can say about Naruto (and derivatives)\n                  \n\nis that it is garbage.\n\r\nNever waste your life on this show. You are too good of a human to be marred by this disdainful time sink.",
    "\n                     Review for both Shippuden and the Original Naruto.\n\r\n      Naruto is... a journey.\r\n      I remember back in my earlier years of school watching the show late at night was kind of ritualistic for me (together with Shaman King). Now, me being a year away from graduating high school and the show airing for 14 years coming to a close earlier this year, I decided to watch the last 100 or so episodes after taking a long break from anime to put and end to a part of my childhood. Man, did\n                  \n\nI miss out.\r\n      The anime itself, through time, grew and changed, just like everyone that watched it since the beginning. It started off as a silly-headed shounen about ninjas and super powers and ended with the main characters aiming to save the world from devastation.\r\n      Story-wise, Naruto goes through hardships, endures pain, learns from his mistakes and tests his strength against many foes, but ultimately the final showdown is between him and his first rival, which proves that the show didn't lose focus throughout the years and finished on the note that Kishimoto wanted to (brilliant on his part).\r\n  While the artstyle is unique and easily-recognizable even for non-anime viewers, quality really drops at time, most evident in the filler episodes, which I'll talk about later on.\r\n  Music is really well put all-around, it makes you pumped when there's an action scene coming up, makes you emotional when something sad happens and makes you literally laugh out loud when needed.\r\n      Something that strikes me as surprising is how well-developed is the supporting staff. Most of them are filled with personality and distinguishable, likable design. For every arc focused on Naruto, there are a couple focused on his friends that help him through his path, which leads me to my next point.\r\n Naruto's motto, ninja way or nind\u014d or whatever you want to call it, is that of never running away or going back on his word, which really speaks about the show itself and the lesson it wants to teach.  As the already mentioned hardships suggest, Naruto never altered his vision or casted aside someone else's feeling or dreams, showing that there is always a reason to try your hardest and be righteous.\r\n     Not everything is without its mistakes, though. The only gut-wrenching flaw about the series is how. many. god. damn. filler. episodes. there. are. They make up about half of the episodes, while most of the provide little to no content. To cut some slack off, some of the arcs are pretty amusing by themselves and deserve a watch.\r\n      Overall, the anime is great, it certainly has a special place in my heart, even if I won't revisit it sheerly because of volume. As undoubtedly one of the most memorable long-running anime out there, it surely is  a thing to relish if not for the entertainment it brings, but for the millions of people that it inspired, just like dragon ball did to the previous generation. Now the baton is passed to his son, Boruto, and only time will tell if he'll make his dad proud.",
    "\n                Long-standing animes like Naruto often compromise quality in favour of quantity. The appeal of such shows, akin to One Piece or Dragonball, typically lies in the enduring relationship between the characters and the viewers. However, the narrative too often morphs these characters into conduits for fan service, constantly introducing new power-ups, fresh appearances, and monumental battles.\n\r\nViewer interest and engagement primarily rely on these characters since the plot, in itself, is not robust enough to warrant the series' extended duration. That's why there's a high degree of hesitance when it comes to eliminating vital characters. While such instances occur, they fail to convincingly echo the looming\n                  \n\nthreat that the antagonist should symbolize in the grand scheme.\n\r\nDespite the narrative's intensive focus on the protagonists' journeys, it is heavily dependent on prior events and characters. These elements are frequently revisited, revised, and reframed via an extensive array of flashbacks. Consequently, we're left with a protagonist who is burdened with resolving past conflicts to which he's only indirectly connected. However, the narrative does not delve into this resolution. The protagonist's primary motivation remains his determination/obsession to safeguard his friends, and the plot expediently facilitates his triumph until the very end, treating conflict resolutions as passive byproducts. This prompts a legitimate question: why not shift the timeline backwards and engage with characters as protagonists who are directly linked to these central conflicts? (Jiraiya, Itachi, Kakashi, et cetera)\n\r\nAs the anime advances, the plot elements increasingly descend into chaos, imbalance and stepping over boundaries. The initial premise established by the first season of Naruto gradually fades, and we're left with a depiction that essentially replicates a generic shonen anime. Power levels are disproportionately and exponentially increased, character decisions are plot-driven rather than stemming from their authentic natures, side characters are relegated to obscurity, and new hurdles are conveniently invented whenever it suits the show-runner/author.\n\r\nIn essence, Naruto is a battle-centric shonen spectacle that exhibits brilliance in sporadic plot points but primarily serves as a platform to develop a franchise. It attempts to craft an epic saga around two central characters that persist until the very end. Sadly, the writer's focus on highlighting these two main characters often results in neglecting the quality and richness of the broader narrative landscape.",
    "\n                I'm sorry.. it's just so bad in my opinion of course.\r\nThe art is dumbed down from the original series, the sound is... pretty much the same stuff. The character development for the new characters is pretty good...\r\nEnjoyment.. is bad because.. well... FILLERS... EVERYWHERE... it tries making you bored out of your mind or on the edge of your seat so even the most pointless event seem exciting. It's dragged out so long. I believe it should only be around 50-100 episodes. I quit watching the original Naruto at like 80 then started watching Shippuuden because my friend really likes it, but we literally skimmed through\n                  \n\nthe first 40 episodes within about 2 hours, and I did not miss any details at all. I discussed the main bad points about Naruto with my friend and he agreed with all of them which include the ones that I have talked about before.\r\nThey're overcomplicating it in my opinion, and should stay focused on the main problem, create \"sub\"-problems that lead up to ending the main conflict, which seem to be the problem with a lot of mainstream shounen anime. They try making a series as long as possible to make the most money out of it rather then creating a good story, with good art, and characters that a person will thoroughly enjoy.\n\r\nOverall, Naruto Shippuuden gets a 5/10, There are a lot of shorter anime series that gets to the point of the anime which are much more exciting, because they cram all their interesting ideas into a short time span rather than having a single event drag out over a term of 3-10 episodes.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of Naruto. Naruto Shippuden is definitely better than Naruto. Here's is what I thought about the show so far:\n\r\nStory: The story is pretty interesting and unpredictable. You not going to know what going to happen next. Some episodes might be drag on and a big amount of flashbacks are shown in almost every episode so it might be a little bit boring for some people. If you are a patience person then you can make it through the show, the show gets better as time goes on.\n\r\nArt: The art is a step-up from the original series but I woudn't said\n                  \n\nthat the art is great. I noticed that Naruto Shippuden uses different animation in different arcs. The show never stick with one animation. Some episodes the animation might be really good and some episodes the animation is just horrible. Overall, most episodes have decent animation so the art wouldn't be a big problem.\n\r\nSound: Naruto Shippuden's Soundtrack is not as good as the first series. However, The OPs and EDs are great.\n\r\nCharacter: Naruto Shippuden have a variety of characters with different personalities. Some characters had developed while some other characters didn't develop much (except their appearance). The characters in Shippuden are lovable so I beleived that you guys will find at least one person that you like.\n\r\nOverall: Naruto Shippuden might be boring in some cases but if you are patience, you will be rewarded BECAUSE WHEN NARUTO SHIPPUDEN IS GOOD, IT'S GOOD.",
    "\n                An allegorical representation of the world, its histories and social problems.\n\r\nDepth: 2/2\r\nImportance: 2/2\r\nRelevance: 2/2\r\nArtistry: 2/2\r\nImagination: 2/2\n\r\nTotal: 10/10\n\r\nThe greatest story there ever was, a modern epic, the most important produce of the manga/anime industry. Each character represents the diverse emotional problems people face in their lives. There is a war-torn era, a post-war era and another war-torn era, and finally an era of peace. In all this, the mangaka didn't forget to show how it all began, giving a very interesting symbolic history of the world's past. Then, there are the heart-wrenching representations of the war-orphans, the downtrodden, the outcasted and even the privileged. The antagonists\n                  \n\nhave also been shown to possess really important reasons to turn against the norms. Philosophies of peace, conviction, life, death, art, purpose, etc are voluminous. As a shounen, it has the most creative battle scenes and character developments. The art and animation are brilliant. There are references to Japanese, Indian and other cultures, traditions and myths throughout the story. The sacrifices done for national cause, the underlying political crises, all are shown with brilliant symbolism. Kishimoto is a rare genius and should be considered a legend. The beautiful background scores and heart-touching ending songs all make it a very emotional watch. Especially, the MC being the most motivational and iconic character in any work of fiction. A must watch for every being living in this world!\n\r\nNote: The DIRAI technique of rating was developed by me. Five criteria to rate any work of art, across any genre. The aggregate of these five lends the final rate. All five criteria are equally necessary. You can't call one greater than the other.\n\r\n-Depth is the layered meaning of a story. How symbolic or allegorical a work of art is.\r\n-Importance is how necessary a work is. How significant it is with respect to social, historical, philosophical, political and scientific standpoints.\r\n-Relevance is how appropriate a work of art is with respect to the current time, period or circumstances. It lends weight to the work. Even symbolic reference to the modern civilization is a great factor for relevance.\r\n-Artistry is how a work of art is executed or portrayed.\r\n-Imagination is the thinking up of new ideas. Be it in the form of new characters or a mind blowing story, a new tune or a new kind of literature itself.\n\r\nP.S.: Lots of reviewers tend to rate works by how much they were able to relate. I do not even consider that a factor. Entertainment and relatability are not proper criteria for reviews. Well, whatever, thank you. This is my first review, I shall be posting more very soon.",
    "\n                I have to say, this is one of the best anime I have ever seen. I've always neglected watching Naruto because of how big it is, but I finally took a chance, and finished it within 3 days because of how amazing the story development was. And now, Naruto Shippuuden is even better.\n\r\nStory - 9\r\nFirst of all, this an amazingly thought out story. From the history to the jutsu (ninja abilities), it all connected so well. The provided explanations for how the characters execute their abilities, it just can't compare to one piece, with how you eat some devil's fruit and gain powers. I understand\n                  \n\nthe stories are completely different, and one piece is one of my favorites, but Naruto is just so much better when it comes to being realistic, to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if there were actually ninja who could mold chakra in this world. Also, Naruto (shippuuden) is not one of those anime where the main characters are always able to win against an enemy. But that's what I love about it, and with how the main chars aren't just given massive powers from the start. They have to work for their skills. And even in the most dire situations, they aren't able to get past it.\n\r\nArt - 10\r\nUnlike \"modern day\" anime such as SAO, the character profiles aren't just smooshed at the mouth, nor are the nostrils just magically not there. All parts of anatomy are present! Other than that, the art is amazing, especially in battle scenes. Just watch it. You can understand what I mean.\n\r\nSound - 10\r\nOne of the main things that makes this anime so good is the ost and op... and the necessary, icky, but realistic, sound of weapons piercing flesh. The openings are really suitable to the anime, and it's a nice selection of music. Especially OP 3 (watch the anime to hear what it sounds like! don't just go to google). And then there's the sound tracks of the animation. Probably one of the best I've heard. Although each OST is suited to their situation and/or scene, it's mainly the sad tracks that wow me. They convey the perfect feeling of sorrow, whilst at the same time emulating the theme of Naruto. What I mean is, at sad moments, you feel sad, and it sounds like a typical Japanese instrument, which, in the Naruto time period, that's what people would be using. Tabun.\n\r\nCharacter  - 10\r\nHere we go! Well, actually, to see the char development you'd have to start from Naruto, when they were actually... developing. But from the start of Naruto to Shippuuden, the characters never fail to amaze me. If you had seen Naruto, you would assume the evil characters are just evil, the side characters are just boring, and the main characters are just the epitome of justice. No. All of the characters have another side to them, and I hadn't known that until watching Shippuuden. Even the side chars. Down to their family history, all of the characters are just so well developed. I hadn't even known (***spoiler*** well it's not that important anyway) Asuma was Sarutobi-sensei's son until season 2. Not to mention, who would have thought Naruto's teacher would be some perverted hermit, instead of a clean, know-it-all peacemaker. Like Konohamaru's teacher, you know, the guy with the glasses. JK.\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the anime the whole time, EXCEPT the fillers. Definitely not the fillers. eaughh. That doesn't mean all the fillers though. I just mean those fillers that don't show any character development, just another mission, or another waste of time. But that's only a small fragment of the anime. Shippuuden that is. For those of you who have seen Naruto, remember that massive section of fillers? Again, eaughh.\n\r\nOverall - 10...00000000\r\n:D",
    "\n                One of the most mind blowing i have ever seen. just ... just think about fantastic and fabulous and that is how you can describe naruto shippuden its fantaboulolous i assure you will love this anime it will make you cry even if your heart is made up of stone, no offense of course but seriously it is one of the big three you just have to watch it if you haven't you can not really call yourself an anime fan.

    "\n                Well .. so as One Piece and Bleach .. this anime is one of the most known animes around the western world.. well there are a lot of theories about it but let me notice you .. POPULARITY DOES NOT MEAN IT IS GOOD ! \n\n\r\nThis anime started extremely well, with epic scenes and epic battles plus a nice pace on the development and a good work on exploring the main characters.. combined with a nice sound track and a fair art, it could be a 9/10 .. BUT .. it makes the same mistake as one piece .. IT'S TOO DAMN LOOOOOOOONG so it\n                  \n\ngets repetitive and meaningless .. plus the action gets worst so as the pace and the character development is always the same. I mean for more than 200 eps i'm hearing this :\" I'm not alone, i have friends, so i'm strong and i won\u00b4t lose ! Oh and i want to be Hokage by the way\" .. just makes no sense .. \n\r\nTalking about this anime makes me sad because i always think how much potential was wasted here .. \n\r\nStory : 9/10 . Well i will have to talk about the first season, \"Naruto\". Here the plot was a 10/10. Just perfect. The plot is interesting, creative and original at astonishing levels and it just looks extremely great. Since the first episodes they give us some mysteries and throughout the show they will reveal them and adding another misteries related to the plot .. which make us throughout the first season of Naruto (taking out the last 2 arcs which are fillers) and the first part of Naruto Shipudden hooked to the plot because we always have something to figure out.  \n\r\nBUT .. now they at the current time of the anime, they already explored everything, and the anime is just boring.. there are no secrets anymore, i already know the entire history since the beginning of the world it self ! Now we are just seeing extended crappy fights with shit talks about friendship for like 15 min of each episode .. i'm done with that ! Plus they always are showing the same thing over and over again .. why? Because they don\u00b4t have anything else to show. \n\r\nAn example is like how Garen became one of the Naruto's closest friend .. i've seen that memory so many times throughout the fights which is just stupid .. the same thing happens with all of the other characters.. so every episode we have 3-4 min of crappy fights, the rest is just the characters talking to themselves the same thing over and over again.  \n\r\nPlus .. the piece of art that they had was just amazing .. and they were able to blow it up to what we have now .. a silly ninja story which only focuses the importance of friends .. it's so disappointing .. For the first part of the show, we can see some maturity in the anime, which is pretty rare for a shonen. It talks about interesting themes and have some nice conversations .. now ? It looks like they copied One Piece .. It really makes me mad. The plot used to look mature, now it looks so childish.. \n\r\nThe action reached ridiculous levels .. at the begining of Naruto Shippuden, some fights were beyond epic. Each fight had a \"mini twist\" when it comes to the actual power of the characters .. so when we think he is using his best skill, we get to know that he has more powerfull skills to show, which make the action so good. Plus, each character has a lot of special skills, different from each other, so we can\u00b4t never predict what he is going to do. Now ? Basically they do a contest about who can make the biggest explosion. So naruto trhowing Rasengans all over the place, and the openents doing the same thing with some kind of \"energy ball\".. how cool is that? (it really sucks)\n\r\nArt: 6/10. The detail is almost none because to \"hide\" the detail they make some huge explosions and everything gets covered by dust, and the characters don\u00b4t look great. The background is also weak, so nothing here excels. \n\r\nSound: 9/10. Every single opening is pretty damn good (check on the web and see how many openings are only for naruto shipudden), the OST are memorable ! I mean i loved the entire OST related to Akatsuki and the Bijus. Just incredible damn good. It fits nice with the action, give us a nice mood and ultimately, some epic scenes. \n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Another failure .. did you ever heard about Itachi? Or Nagato? Or Madara? You probably heard about them all .. they are just astonishing characters with a excelent background story .. meanwhile .. the FUCKING 5 HOKAGES ARE THE SAME SHIT . Yes .. the same shit. \"I will protect my village\" it's basically all they have to say. Plus every other characters (like Naruto's friends) are just there to be there. They have no development at all, they are just there to fill in. And then we have characters like Sakura. Well she says \"i won\u00b4t be dependent on Naruto anymore\" like 5 times, after each times she ends up depending on him for everything. Naruto carries his village and it's the only \"OP\" character at the moment, which is a shame. In Naruto and even in the first part of shippuden, we do have some nice characters getting development and being part of some excelent fights.\r\nNow? It's basically waiting naruto using Rasengan 1000 times and defeat the enemies.  \n\r\nAll the characters can be resumed with this sentence: I have friends, so i will always win. \n\r\nThe villians: I'm alone, because that's how we can get true power. Friends are nothing. \n\r\nIt really works like that, each character has the same motivations, if it is a villian, probably he had some dark past and now he belives he is better alone. Is it is a good guy, he belives in friends and that kind of stuff. Really there is 0 variety when it comes to characters. (of course taking out those 3 that i talked about) \n\r\nAbout Naruto it self .. well the typical shonen main character.. about his rival, Sasuke.. he had his highlight on Naruto and Naruto Shippuden first part .. well now it's just a pussy and no one cares about him. \n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. It's just boring, meaningless .. for an action anime, there is no action. That's all i have to say. \n\r\nOverall: 6/10. As you were able to see, we can divide Naruto Shippuden into 2 parts. The first part (9/10) and the second part (4/10) .. which only makes a 6/10. If the show is going to get better? Well i don\u00b4t know, hopefully it will, but i doubt .. for who likes shonens, there are betters out there, even though this anime has the best plot i've ever seen, it does not worth the 100 fillers plus the crappy low anime that is being now .. if i advise this one? Well at least the first part is great, the second one? Don\u00b4t touch it. I consider the first part everything except the fillers from the first episode of shippuden until the beggining of the 4th ninja war.",
    "\n                When I first heard that will be a sequel to Naruto i thought WOW that's cool, but I hope that the filler episodes won't  apear in the new Shippuuden. But to that Later...\n\r\nStory/ The story is great, many twist, many thrilled moments and so on. But that's only the main sotry from the manga. Sadly... everytime when a main arc is enden a new filler arc begins... I wouldn't complain if the filer arc would be over 2-5 episodes, but those damn fillers won't get off of my screen!!! The avarage duration is between 15-20 episodes so that means over 15 weeks of suffering\n                  \n\nand bleeding... But if it wouldn't of the grat and I have to it again GREAT main story outline, the rating could be much worse...\n\r\nAnimation/ Well... unfortunately I have to say it's just sad... The first episodes were very good animated but as the time pased the animation gets worse and worse... But there are a few episodes that are great animated for example: Ep. 26 or 85 and the episode when team Kakashi (Yamato) meat Sasuke. First I thought WOW finally the animation gets better, but after 2-3 episodes it gets miserable again... I think it's year 2009 and not 1992... Even Dragon ball had a better animation quality and try to find how old that anime is... In my opinion animaton is the weakest part of Shippuuden\n\r\nSound/  Is very good, not better then the original Naruto but much better then other anime series. The openings and Endings are nice to hear and some openings I had to download becouse I liked them a lot. And the OST supports the episodes very well. Good JOB.\n\r\nCharacter/  Finally the strongest site of all the Naruto series. Naruto is very well known of the deep  character outline. EVEN THE FILLER characters are well done becouse all of the characters have their own past (mostly sad). some of them are evil and some of them are moch worse and I can't think of their next move. And here we are the good characters... I'm the badguy so the goodguys are only in my way :D, but most of the good characters are losers or geniuses with a sad past and their will force them to maximum. And Naruto when he doesn't give up and tries to others believed in him then so do I. \n\r\nEnjoyment/  I have to admit that i enjoied Naruto Shippuuden a LOT and even the stupid fiilers can't change that. \n\r\nOverall/  Naruto Shippuuden is a well done sequel with some mistakes. Some of the mistakes are big and some small but the good side overhelmed the Fillers.\n\r\nPS: Sorry for my bad English :D Im from Czech adn I'M 16 so :D",
    "\n                I can't blame you guys who didn't like this anime because of fillers and the likes. But i admit, I am one of the so called Narutards who manages to like this series more and more because for me, this is one of the best anime I ever watched.\n\r\nSTORY - 9\n\r\nI know many of you are sick of this \"guy chasing a guy\" thing and I am getting tired of it too that is why i gave a 9 for the story. Having this stated, I am giving appreciation to the story's complexity as it gives an amazing twist and and revelation as the story\n                  \n\ngoes. As they say, this is a continuation of \"returning sasuke back\" arc which made this Shippuden's main goal is to return/save sasuke than Naruto being a hokage and that irritated me but then again, i don't give too much attention to this story, instead, i give importance to what the story stands right now.\n\r\nART and SOUND - 8\n\r\nI'm not that choosy when it comes to art as long as their is a projection of image and proper representation of what should be done and executed. But with the sound, I liked the sound tracks from the previous Naruto because of its uniqueness that made me feel the reality of each event. The liked the OPs more the EDs. EDs did not struck me that's why i listen to OPs that made me say Sha La La.\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\n\r\nI don't want to give any comment for each character present as all of them really have their own progress as the series moves forward but what i can say is that, Naruto and Sasuke are the most I*&w3*9 ever!!! i don't know why naruto stills wants to have sasuke back. did they have intimate moments with each other privately? (O_o) how can you consider someone a friend if he himself doesn't want to return and to be with you. And this sasuke is such an ugly dick who wants his armpits licked!\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9\n\r\nit may look contradicting from what i have said above but those are just individual thoughts that bugged me off personally and these won't affect my overall experience in watching this anime. since for me, the story is great but not perfect and the way it gives the twist and revelation makes me want to watch the next episode (not the filler though). And still, i am looking forward for a greater arc and will forever be a fan of Naruto.",
    "\n                who ever says naruto is a kids TV show is completely wrong.\n\r\nnaruto: shippuden is much better than the original series (even though the original was still very good) as it much more serious which is good and bad. The story is amazing because it is so different to any other anime I've watched and I love all of the characters because they are original and are all well build up and they all have great personalities. It is so gripping I found myself thinking about it all the time and I could not stop watching it will I was catching up to the latest episode.\n\r\nPeople\n                  \n\nsay that is \"all filler\" and boring but I would rather the story be slow paced and have actual canon content most of the time than a few fast paced episodes and then fillers all the time throughout. Even though it is slow paced in places it still good and they make it good even though it's kind of slow. \n\r\nSeriously, it is my favorite anime ever just because of the great story, so many lovable characters, great battle music, and because it has made my want to be a konoha shinobi! :(",
    "\n                Well this review will probably butthurt the majority, if not all, of the Naruto fanbase. I liked Naruto, overall I enjoyed all aspects of it except the art which wasn't the best, I thought that Shippuuden would be equally as good, or even better. How wrong I was, it is terrible. \n\r\nStoryline - The events continue from the previous series with Naruto trying to find his friend (Sasuke) who has gone all dark and power hungry. Overall Naruto Shippuuden is an absolute nightmare, from season 1 onwards you have non-stop fillers. The amount of times the story progession gets hindered due to fillers is endless\n                  \n\nand it is like this repeatedly in every season.\n\r\nArt and Sound - The art is ok, but sometimes feels a bit stiff, backgrounds sound weren't best, although the music was good.\n\n\r\n Character - Yes there is some decent characters, but very few of the characters get any real developement. \n\r\nEnjoyment - Starts out ok, but it goes downhill fast, and eventually it gets to the point where waiting 2 hours for a bus becomes more exciting then watching this.",
    "\n                Now I know you might be surprised of my score since Naruto Shippuden seems it had gone through a lot of hate lately mostly because of the filler episodes however, it didn't seem to bother me that much. Sure, there are some fillers from a few episodes ago but it will be until episode 100 after they stop with the \"overwhelming\" amount of fillers in each episode.\r\n---\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is about the same Naruto we knew from the main series however, now that he is more mature he will get over following Sasuke all the time and focus on training to become a hokage (P.S. I\n                  \n\nwas just joking, the whole plot now focuses on this whole part).\n\r\nLeaving the jokes aside, although the story focuses on Sasuke throughout the whole series, like OnePiece, it shows how hard it is to achieve something you want after you see how much you have to go in order to accomplishing it. \n\r\nArt: As you *may know*, long running series start off with lower graphics and then grow in quality by a lot although the graphics it started off didn't bother me at all, It's just the way they try to covering things to save more budget is really bad. No further comments there. (8/10)\n\r\nSound: Surprisingly enough, I just love the Naruto Shippuden soundtracks since I am a big fan of Japanese instrumental songs, However! It could get really annoying as it gets overused as many other long running series do the same thing to safe money which is understandable, but I didn't feel like they were as good as in the main series, remember those sad soundtracks which really gave you the vibes when they started? Well, none of these here which was really my main disappointment. (7/10)\n\r\nCharacter: If there's something Naruto Shippuden has improved in from the main series, it would be the animation and characters. The characters have evolved a lot in mental as well as physical strength (ex: Shikamaru) which also made the Naruto series somewhat more *mature*. \n\r\nEnjoyment: Too lazy to continue so ==> (8/10)\n\r\nOverall:\r\nIn conclusion the story is pretty good executed although there are bits missing here and there.\r\nHope you enjoyed my boring review.",
    "\n                PLOT & STORYTELLING: The plot as a whole started out to be intriguing, very much at that. Amazing would be the ideal fashion to describe such a strong start. I still remember how well of a first arc the \"Kazekage Rescue Mission Arc\" was. But it was \"Pain's Assault Arc\" where the series peaked with a thematic value escalating the narrative to a brand new level. Absolutely zero boring canon arcs prior to that arc overall. I could feel a \"heart\" in the series. I felt confident that \"yeah boy, it really will live upto the expectations.\" But unfortunately after that, the series took a\n                  \n\nmassive hit in its quality & went all downhill once the final major arc in \"War\" began after a fabulous buildup. The reanimation jutsu, Madara, Kaguya & what not. It felt as if the series is happening all too suddenly now without any sort of buildup or convincing plot points whatsoever. Contextualising certain scenes with flashbacks was one process I started to hate after a period of time. On top of everything, the obvious lack of a political magnitude most likely hurt the storytelling department the most in my eyes. Another thing was the whole point of the show being ignored \u2014 Naruto became Hokage, only in the OVA, not in the main series with numerous filler arcs & 500 episodes overall. That's disappointing too. And with all those annoying and some rare good filler arcs alike, the plot & storytelling in my opinion was extremely mediocre overall.\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Being the centre of attention of the series, Naruto stayed true to his characteristics and grew upon well & somewhat satisfyingly, at the cost of the charm but with the addition of maturity. Though the usage of the common \"Nakama\" trope felt bit too much at times & the lack of development of a tactical aspect of Naruto was a missed potential. And of course, there were a handful of good characters present in the series like Jiraiya, Kakashi, Gaara, Pain & all but the amount of characters staying insignificant throughout the series was disappointing to think. Hinata, Nejj, Lee, Choji & more, you name it. Then there was Sakura who had a significant growth in characteristics but still felt insignificant on the larger scale. And there was this forced dynamics between Sasuke & Naruto that was preferred to be grown awkwardly ahead of the natural parallel between Gaara & Naruto or the childhood bond between Shikamaru & Naruto. The problems in handling and utilising such a massive cast was evident throughout the series & to my eyes, this is arguably the worst segment of the series.\n\r\nVILLAINS: Akatsuki surely have best set of villains, or rather antagonists. The underlying depth within was always present. From Itachi to Pain, to Sasori to Madara, there were different people with different problems that were all presented well altogether. Their motive made a lot of sense too. But actual question lies within the success rate of a well written conclusion to the group or the individuals. My answer? I was disappointed. Except for Pain & Itachi (and early Akatsuki villains), the major guys couldn't live upto the bigger expectations. And Kaguya? I prefer not to speak. So all in all, villains weren't bad at all but the utilisation could've been much better. In the end, they didn't impress me therefore.\n\r\nART & DESIGNS: This is a department where Naruto Shippuden was pretty good. The new designs of Naruto, Neji, Sasuke, Pain, Madara, Deidara, Temari, Ino, Obito & many more were simply fabulous. Even if you don't like those characters, you're still bound to like their beautifully handcrafted designs. But then there are Zetsu that looked awful no matter what. So it wasn't really all too flawless but regardless, hats off to Kishimoto (and Pierrot too) for pulling off such great designs throughout the series.\n\r\nACTION & POWER-SYSTEM: The power system was swift, simplistic & did its job well. Although in Part 1, the fights were a lot more tactical. In Shippuden, however, the fights became flashier & more about overpowering. Though, that's acceptable with the fabulous choreography & animation most of the major battles had. Narratively too, a lot of battles will remain memorable forever. But what isn't acceptable for me actually is the power ceiling that was brutally broken during the War Arc. At the end of the Shippuden, there's probably not a single person on planet earth who can rival Naruto or Sasuke. Not a fan of ridiculously OP power levelling but since this particular series ended, it won't leave you a room for complaining much.\n\r\nWORLD-BUILDING: The world was explored a lot more in Shippuden compared to the Part 1. World expansion was swift & well but not satisfying given the amount of proper exploration there was. I was always curious to find the lives of others in the other hidden villages. But in the end, it held no significance down the road or in the plot given most of the events took place in Hidden Leaf Village anyway. The culture, however, could've been shown on a much better level. As if every village-men are all same, only thing that differs is the place where they live. Also, politics barely had any significance of a world-building consisting a governing body. Population never had any sort of reaction even after so many wars & conflicts other than during the end of Pain's Assault Arc. Therefore, at times, the hatred towards Jinchuriki felt a bit too unrealistic. But the lores were carried out well to a certain point. But overall, world building was very mediocre.\n\n\r\nMUSIC: This is probably the one of the two departments in my opinion in which Naruto Shippuden is nearly flawless. From the background scores to the opening/ending themes, everything was just spot on. There were a lot of memorable OPs with few of them being legendary in fact.\n\r\nVOICE ACTING: I've seen entirety of the series in English dub & honestly speaking, I loved it. Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunade, Sakura, Sasuke, Gaara, Naruto & many more... The cast was just ideal & their performances were even better. Flawless really.\n\r\nANIMATION: Inconsistent. But for a weekly anime it was totally acceptable. For a weekly anime to have that many amount of well animated fights is very rare, take One Piece for example.\n\r\nPACE: Consistently well in the canon arcs adaptation (if not the arcs directly) & consistently terrible in most of the filler arcs. Overall, calling it poor would be perfect. Adaptation could've been much better with Naruto being a weekly manga with no hiatus whatsoever.\n\r\nMOVIES & SPECIALS: The last three movies & the Boruto movie were good to great. I enjoyed them. Prior to them, not so much. And the specials? I liked nearly all of them!\n\r\nOVERALL: The first half of Shippuden & second half of Shippuden feels completely different. Quality was what being escalated every now & then in the first half with personal investment level reaching sky. But seeking moments here & there to keep the boredom out became my habit in the second half. This is all about subjectivity but unless you've seen only a few anime; or you're young and into mainstream battle shonen; or you're intriguingly obsessed with Naruto, there's no solid reason to watch Naruto Shippuden after \"Pain's Assault Arc.\" Skipping the fillers is must & even then, boredom from nearly half of Shippuden is guaranteed with the terribly written War Arc. A smooth experience is something you can't really expect. But if you're young, you're in for witnessing an unforgettable journey of an oppressed underdog who lost his parents after birth due to a reason that changed the whole world in an emotional story of bonds. \"Watch-and-forget-during-the-lockdown\" is probably most ideal way to describe the mediocre show personally.",
    "\n                Let me start off this review by saying the Naruto series is my favorite series of all time, I absolutely love it but I'm going to do my best to review this fairly with a leveled mind.\n\r\nLet's start off with the story the base story is amazing it's honestly a work of art. The key word in that sentence was a base story unfortunately, corporate greed ruined it. The studio that makes Naruto (Studio Pierrot) released an episode of Naruto every time a chapter of naruto was release. The problem with this is Naruto episodes contain multiple chapters of the manga so naturally, the manga\n                  \n\nartists couldn't keep up, therefore leaving us with filler. I think that there is a filler that you can like but there is so much filler that they can't make sequels to them so they just leave us with crap. I strongly believe that once you get past the filler the main storyline more than makes up for it.\n\r\nThe next is the art, corporate greed also put a damper on how good this could have been. Studio Pierrot is known for only saving their amazing animations till a big fight/scene (ex. Tokyo Ghoul) so besides this one point, the art is very reasonable.\n\r\nAnother thing I absolutely love about Naruto is the intros and outros, they are each amazing in every single way and I would watch Naruto over again solely for the intros.\n\r\nFinally the characters/character development. I love all the characters so much and I think the writer did an amazing job creating them, I even think temporary characters (Characters we see in filler/side characters). That being said Character development is a completely different story. Besides characters like Naruto, Sasuke, and maybe Rock Lee, each character gets an arc where you learn a bit about them and then they become basically irrelevant for the rest of the show if they don't die. They could have made Naruto a lot better if they tried replacing some of the filler with either more character development for side characters/main characters or if they made sequels to their fillers.",
    "\n                God do I love this show. Yup, I'm another generic childhood fan, but I'm still going to write a review. \n\r\nI'll be fair, and point out the cons first. The first major con, the sheer amount of filler is crazy. I remember enjoying some of the filler, but most of it I would skip. Next, the flashback scenes. Sometimes flashbacks are necessary if it's been a while and you may have forgotten some details, however, it's not necessary every other episode. They were fine with the flashbacks until a certain point, then it got annoying. There, cons are finished, so let me speak of the\n                  \n\npros now.\n\r\n The music for one is amazing. They know how to hype you up with the music, and it works every time. The opening theme songs are honestly some of the best you'll ever find, and I will fight anyone on that. The characters, antagonists and plot are also interesting and keep you invested. There are very few anime that make me feel the way this does. I'm being biased, I admit, but I'm not going to remove my rose-colored glasses. The animation is fantastic and the fights intense, I always loved it when Shikamaru fought. All in all, my love for this show is a mixture of nostalgia and the fact that it really is amazing.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden is hyped up way too much. It's just average at best in my opinion. The show's only strong point is nostalgia and the music.\n\r\nSTORY/PLOT:  We see Naruto after a three-year time skip. He has gotten taller and has definitely changed in some way. The MC who rebelled that he won't become a tool to the village, in turn, becomes one because he wishes to be acknowledged by them and become Hokage.\n\r\nNaruto's goal mostly in Shippuden is to bring Sasuke back. He trains hard and learns a new Jutsu and sage mode. Shippuden completely debunks the fact that Naruto is an underdog.\n                  \n\nHe is apparently a child with powerful parents and has genetics in his favor, he's also CHILD OF THE PROPHECY and REINCARNATION OF NINJA JESUS. How inconsistent!\n\r\nSasuke was more of a protagonist than Naruto himself. He killed a major villain, gathered a team, and freed the captives. He learned a lot of Jutsu by himself and kept moving towards his goal. Itachi was a confusing mess of a character. He should've remained the heartless brother and the war criminal who betrayed his own clan. He also mentally tortured his younger brother.\n\r\nThe Akatsuki were an interesting bunch. Pein arc is said to be one of the best arcs in the show. But it ended badly. Pein was too easily influenced by the mc. Obito was pathetic as a villain. Madara was too over-powered. Kaguya was unnecessary. It was a play of flashy powers and magic eyeballs with huge power-ups.\n\r\nThe story went downhill. The ending was a huge disappointment. Too many plot holes, Naruto gets married to an irrelevant side character and Kakashi is Hokage? The ending was heavily from Hinata's perspective, Naruto wasn't even planning to get married. Sasuke's character never got proper closure, the same with Naruto. Konoha side characters are just shoved aside, Neji accepts his destiny and dies for NH.\r\nWhy is Kakashi Hokage again?\n\r\nART: The animation was good, the fights were animated well. But ofc the quality tends to go down at times. Naruto's design was bland, Sakura's outfit just sucked and Sasuke kept changing styles. It wasn't much of a bother.\n\r\nSOUND: This show put out some really good themes and music. The themes were also pretty good. \n\r\nCHARACTERS: Sadly the characters weren't all that great. The females were poorly written, as always. Naruto doesn't learn anything from his experiences. He's a mere teen with absolutely no understanding of how the world and Shinobi system works. But still, he has plot armor and his talk no Jutsu to the villains is rarely challenged.\r\nSasuke's character doesn't get a proper closure. He wanted a revolution in the Shinobi world. But he's convinced to give up on his goal and goes on a journey to atone for his sins.\r\nCharacter potential is a red herring for side characters. Shikamaru's development arc was just not out there. There was too much emphasis on Uchiha Senju drama. I didn't like the concept of how the Uchihas are genetically evil and the Senjus good. \n\r\nOVERALL: It wasn't that great. The immense number of fillers doesn't help. The pacing was terrible, flashbacks overused. The ending was just a shipping frenzy.  The show has its good points - the characters had interesting backgrounds and brought up a lot of issues. Sadly those were not worked out well.",
    "\n                After an endless wasteland of anticlimactic resolutions, I would like to express the disgust I have towards this work. ''Naruto'' prequel laid the foundations for this story, which although they stood out in some sections, in others they seemed really questionable, and Naruto Shippuden resolved my doubts.\r\nI will expand on 3 points.\r\n1: How does the Ninja World rank system work?\n\n\n\r\nThey come out of the academy and are Genin, fine (\"fine\", since ordinary people hire them to do necessary jobs like mowing the lawn and doing chores), then they have an exam to be chunnin, fine (\"fine\", since really at no time are the genin given\n                  \n\ntime to learn shit and learning is left to the Jonin in charge, which proves to be inefficient because \"muh one of them is my favorite and I'm going to train him, what fuck the rest\").\n\n\n\r\nAfter the chunin exam comes the jonnin exam... I guess, we're not shown how it diminishes since you're a chunin. And what the hell is up with the Hokage? It is already canon at this point that Naruto skips two ranks and becomes the president. Why? For being the messiah?\n\n\n\r\nIf you think about it further, the organization itself doesn't make any sense:\r\n1- You are in the academy, you learn the basics\n\n\n\r\n2- You graduate and you are a genin, you do not study and it is intuited that your education from here on is self-taught.\n\n\n\r\n3- You want to be chunin, so you take the exam, and it is intuited that you must know at least some espionage technique or something similar, apart from several Jutsus and a decent fighting technique (are there even libraries where they can study more techniques?)\n\n\n\r\n4- Magically you are Jonin, it is assumed that you are practically one step below the president, you are the standard military force of your village and yet they put you in charge of rookies so that these are your team in missions that due to your rank do not correspond to you (I suppose they will have missions on their own, but it is made clear that the team that was under his command will be with the jonin for a long time until they are promoted to jonin or become academy professors, then what the hell was Kakashi doing with Minato, Obito and Rin if he was already a Jonin at that age?)\n\n\n\r\n5- You are an AMBU, a member of the village's tactical operations squad, basically Team 6 of the Konoha SEALS, or cannon fodder according to the anime. What the hell did the AMBU do if not die every time they appeared? They are a literal joke.\n\n\n\r\n6- Finally you get to be Hokage, apparently here you only need the approval of the elders of the village to be. You don't have ministers or subordinates, it's just you taking care of all the paperwork and paperwork.\r\nFrom smallest to largest:\n\r\n- Why doesn't the Hokage have official subordinates to take care of the paperwork?\n\n\n\r\n- Why leave the heart and the operating system of the village in charge of a single person?\n\n\n\r\n- Why should he be the most powerful and capable man in the village, since in times of crisis he is the one he should protect?\n\n\n\r\n- Why isn't the village in chaos? Clans are supposed to exist and they can wish well for their people, the head of each clan should be sucking the elders' vagina and the malnourished nepe to ensure a position as Hokage and safeguard his clan from power. Internal wars cannot be happening because of that stupid government model.\n\n\r\n2. The characters; There are so many characters that were introduced, with so many, I mean TOO MANY, that it is impossible to focus on all of them or focus entirely on one among so many subplots and a contrast is created with the lost potential, by contrast the \"Characters\" that are it gives them a main focus they have their own reasons for doing what they do and who they are as a whole and that's what makes each character distinctive in their own way minus that some have really anticlimactic resolutions that hurt the writing of these, this mainly in the last arc \"Fourth great ninja war\" this last arc felt bland and insipid, constant changes of morale between different characters that felt forced, constant nerfs to characters that were initially excellent. Add to that, innumerable plot holes, the story is full of script holes, things that are left in the air never to be mentioned again, important fights resolved by deus ex machinas.\n\r\nI can represent all this as a shooting star, the work started out great, but that brightness vanished in the blink of an eye\n\r\n3. Technical section. This is usually precarious and inconsistent, with all this I mean the little use of visual narrative as a resource for exposing ideas, apart from all this, the technical values \u200b\u200bnever seemed remarkable to me, you usually have a fluid animation and an inconsistent drawing for later become inconsistent in these two sections, and that in those static shots, I could never understand what was meant by all this.\n\n\n\r\n(I'm just a casual with a critical eye, I don't take my opinions to the extreme like others would. I don't pick on animation or subtle issues with technical values, I give more value and merit to the script, I look at the bigger picture. So, being that said, please note that this factor will show up in my review).\r\n It's a regular series with big spikes in quality mixed to mediocrity, I'm not a reductionist and appreciated the intention of the series to pretend to give us something ''Good''.",
    "\n                After the marathon of Naruto, we end up here, Shippuuden.\r\nNaruto left the leaf village with Jiraiya and has been away for 2 and a half years.\r\nThat's a massive time jump, so it's going to take a while to learn the little bits and pieces of everything that's been happening while they were away, with both Naruto and Jiraiya, plus all the friends they left behind.\n\r\nIt kicks straight into the main story pretty much immediately, while you're getting all the information about what's been happening in the background. \r\nThe Akatsuki are ready to make their move, Orochimaru is still with Sasuke and the Leaf Village has\n                  \n\nbeen waiting for what Orochimaru has planned and for Naruto to return.\n\r\nIt's really nice to see the progress in the characters, they're still technically kids, but it doesn't seem like it at all. Maybe except for Naruto, he's still pretty immature, the difference is he knows when it's okay to let that side of him out.. Most of the time. It's obvious they've all learned a lot, and it's exciting to see what's different with everyone as time goes on. \n\r\nThe fillers are more abundant than before, but they're still worth watching. Most of them have some main story material through them, though mostly small pieces, they're still important to see.\n\r\nA part I really enjoyed was learning more about characters other than Naruto, seeing as it's such a big series, the other main characters and background ones are still very prominent, it's interesting and you need to learn more about them to see why they are who they are. Once it gets into it, a lot of them have similar backgrounds of losing people and it helps explain why they're all so drawn to and supportive of Naruto and his mission. \r\nTheir backstories really help lay out the plot in more detailed means, it's great when small plot points spiderweb into backgrounds of different people and it all comes together.\r\nThough, you only get the full experience of it by watching the fillers, as that's where most of that information comes from. \n\r\nOne of Naruto's best qualities is that he has such a big heart, like many characters say, he has the ability to inspire anybody without even trying, and he cares so much. \r\nThough from that, Shippuuden isn't holding back on the deaths.. It is a war, after all. So be prepared to be both incredibly sad and really shocked. I was so devastated at one of them I wanted to just quit the series, hibernate for a few days and never return. This is 1 of 3 anime that has made my heart sink to that extent. \r\nWhat adds to the sadness is how caring Naruto is, even people just getting hurt upsets him and makes him so angry that sometimes bad things happen. But when people he cares for die, especially ones that are so close to him, the emotions for that through Naruto are portrayed so well, seeing him cry and be so hurt just makes your heart ache. \n\r\nBig questions start to get answered around halfway through, all the little bits and pieces start making sense and coming together to completely flip situations and the story you thought certain characters had. It's done really well, so it feels even more satisfying when the questions come to light.\n\r\nI'm finishing writing this halfway through, it's a lot to watch all at once unless you've been watching it bit by bit or as it released. \r\nLike the previous, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought it would. Naruto in general gets a lot of judgement for having so much filler. In the first half the characters are kiddy and pretty annoying if you're watching a lot at once, but once you get past that it's a decent series. \r\nI don't regret putting so much time into it and I'm actually looking forward to wherever it may lead. \r\nThis part is definitely better than the first, the story, characters and flow of the series is nicely done and you can't help but crave to know what happens next.\n\r\nIf you're looking at watching this you've either watched Naruto and you're moving on, which you'll really enjoy the evolution of the series. Or you've heard Shippuuden is good but are weary about the amount of episodes and fillers involved, or have trouble pushing through the first part. If you enjoy long series, with adventures, fighting, regular character growth (excluding the time skip but it's pretty well explained so it doesn't really count), good comedy with some pervy goodness added in, plus all the other things the series brings, it'll be worth it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",
    "\n                SPOILER-FREE- No taking about specific characters OR specific events.\n\r\nCHARACTERS:  The best part of the show is the diverse interesting set of characters.   I would argue that I love them more than the main character in many ways.  Everyone has interesting traits and each characters grows and changes during the series.  The Japanese voices are the best in terms of how they are acted. However later in the series it gets to the point where there are too many to keep track of so I made a link to 2 character maps for you for later in the series.  \n\r\nSTORY:\n                  \n\n This is a story about more than ninjas.  It is about community, fighting for your dreams, overcoming prejudice, learning from the regrets of the past, learning to overcome hatred and fighting for a better future for all.  It gets convoluted and difficult to keep track of every character at times.  Every character is developed as the series goes on and has a back story that makes you understand even the worst characters.  The tone of the show ranges from fun & childish to dark.  It all does comes together nicely and is well rounded by the different tones.  \n\r\nOn the downside, there are too many flashbacks that represent more of an emotional state rather than ones that give context to the story so I can forgive those.  The Filler is also beyond bad; however I enjoyed the filler during the great ninja war.  Because of excess of characters it is too easy to become lost and that becomes even worst during the filler episodes.  \n\r\nGRAPHICS/SOUNDS:  It is not important to me (I am a story/character person) so it is best to go to other reviewers.  I mean I love the theme and how it fits.  I love the animation and the sound track\u2026 even after 400+ episodes I never started to hate it.  \n\r\nVOICE ACTING:  Watch the sub version ONLY.  Never watch the English version because the translation and voice acting is terrible. \u201cBelieve it\u201d and believe me. \n\r\nTHE BEST PART:   I feel like this is a piece of art that makes my soul grow/glow warm.  I really care about these characters and the story makes me think about life.  This is a series all about growing up and the change it brings.  \n\r\nWARNING:  You have to watch the original Naruto Series First.  I HIGHLY suggest you only watch the sub version.  The English actors are the worst of the worst.  It is so poorly translated that it will make you HATE this anime.  Also Skip every, and I MEAN EVERY, filler series.  As much of a fan I am I HATE the filler and they are not important to the main story. \n\r\nSKIP THE FILLER EPISODES WHICH ARE: 57-70, 90-111, 144-151, 170 & 171, 223-242, 258-260, 279-281, 284-295, 303-320, 347-361, 376-377, 389-390, 391-393, 394 \u2013 413, 416 \u2013 417, 419, 422-423, 427-I WILL UPDATE.\r\n  I am the type of person that likes to see everything so when I tell you to skip it, you know you can trust me when I say it is stupid, bad, and full of contradictions/plot holes.  I HATE the filler.  My rating of the show with the filler is like a 6.5.  Do not watch it\u2026 just do NOT do that to yourself.  I personally found enjoyment in watching the fillers in the great ninja war but the problem is you get lost because you forget characters and get lost.   I will fill in the fillers I liked later.  \n\r\nOVERALL IMPRESSION:  This is one of the best amines I have ever seen.  Seriously skip the filler and watch the SUB version only.  \n\r\nCHARACTER MAPS: \r\nAfter all AKATSUKI Revealed: http://safrika.deviantart.com/art/Naruto-Complete-Character-Tree-119003764\n\r\nStart of the war: http://penjualkomik.blogspot.com/2010/10/salasilah-komik-naruto-naruto-family.html",
    "\n                I do have to say that most of the time I enjoy watching Naruto but it certainly has its flaws and is far from perfect. I also think that you can't just discard fillers as necessary and just discard them while writing a review. \n\r\nLets start by looking at the most important part of an anime, the story.\r\nThe main story line is actually very well written and thought out. It gets me really into the anime and makes me want to keep watching all day if it were possible. Now the flaw are the fillers. Yes I know that fillers are necessary and I am\n                  \n\nnot saying that I disapprove of fillers. The problem I have with fillers in Naruto is the terrible quality and timing of them. If they were able to make a good storyline for them to follow during the fillers and not suddenly interrupt big moments in the anime I wouldn't mind that much at all.\n\r\nThere were even a few times where I dropped the anime in between because I got bored with it. But after a while I couldn't help myself to start watching again. The reason for this was the main storyline. Without the fillers I would have to give the story a 8 out of 10 but the fillers just take out too much.\n\r\nThe thing I have to like most of all are the characters. Al the important characters have their own background and there is no black and white way of looking at the. The bad guys are not all that bad, they all have there reasons and motivation why they are doing what they do. The only thing that bothers me is the recurring \"Naruto\" type character, that can perfectly relate with the lead character of the show. I feel like they are repeating the same character over and over with just a slight twist each time. \n\r\nSo overall it is a good anime, and the main storyline is good enough to still make it enjoyable overall. I am still hoping that they'll remake the whole thing at some point and just remove all the filler material and also go over some of the artwork, because there were some moments wherein the animators seemed to be rushing.",
    "\n                This show is really intense and if you like a good comedy and action, I highly recommend Naruto Shippuden(Of course you must watch the original.) \r\n     Naruto is a great show with a really deep meaning in it. Such as you are never alone, trust your comrades, and don't go down the dark path. Naruto shows many of these lessons through battles and story. (Watch to find out!)\r\n     Another great thing Naruto does is that it is a really brings emotion to the watcher. To me, what I think every anime must have is emotion. Naruto does\n                  \n\na lot of that, especially Shippuden. With characters dying and tragic story, it 'ought to make you roll a tear down. With funny puns and great comedy, it has to make you laugh. With this emotional content, it makes it a great anime!\r\n     Battles are also something I need to add. With episodes of battle scenes and fighting. With this non stop action, you can't quit. Epic battle scenes that make you say \"WOW!\" Battle scenes with POW! The story makes hang in there until you know.\r\n     One last thing is the story development. What you think happens does not actually happen. So many twist and turns. A story with new things at every corner. You can't predict the ending. Characters that create plot twists, keeps you guessing to the very end.\r\n      So for everyone reading this, I want to let you know that if you are not watching Naruto or Naruto Shippuden, you don't know what your missing.",

    "\n                Best freaking show of all time hands down, no cap. This show changed my life in every way not even joking it has a perfect story full of development and amazing characters. I would highly highly highly recommend this show for many reasons. It taught me more about love, life and faith than anything else. I cannot say enough good about this show. Watch it and stick with it until the end the reward is insane even though it is long it is so worth it. Words don\u2019t do it justice I love it so much. This show is filled with memorable moments and characters\n                  \n\nthat will give you chills and make you a better person at the end. The soundtrack is unbelievably good and will, stick with you forever. This show cuts deep and makes you cry laugh and everything in between. This may seem like a fluffy all good review but that\u2019s because it is a perfect show I am not overdoing my love for this show.",
    "\n                I love watching Naruto series! It always gave me all different types of feels :') I'm gonna say, that it is a beautiful anime. Naruto was one of my first animes to watch and till now its one of my favorites. When I think about that soon the series of 'Naruto' will end makes me sad, because I have watched every episode of it. But because Naruto series probably will be end soon, I hope to see some Boruto series too, hehe :3 \r\nThe only problem (and some can agree with me) are the fillers arc/episode I have to say that I prefer when anime\n                  \n\nis linked to the manga.. But the fillers are also  good because they tell us more about characters and show us some things that happen before. I also think that also characters from Naruto taugh us some important things in life.. for example Naruto himself has proven not to  give up on our dreams because if we work hard and won't lose the hope, our dream can come true. \r\nI am happy that I could watch Naruto from being an clumsly ninja, turning into a hero and hokage \u2665",
    "\n                This is my first time ever writing a review so it probably won't be all that amazing. I don't plan on writing out a novel and will try to keep it as \"short and sweet.\" \n\r\nI have been currently watching Naruto and I am almost completely caught up. I may not be one of those \"die hard\"  fans who've watched episode 1 from day one.  And I was able to \"cheat\"  and pass through all the fillers and focus on the story.  I know naruto gets a lot of hate,  but this is my first time really watching a shounen\n                  \n\nanime and I love it! \n\r\nNow to the point, Naruto may not be the most original of stories since the whole ninja story has been done over and over again. And some parts of the story may  be over done but,  the story still manages to keep me interested and hooked!  In \"Naruto\"  the first series it is definitely more light hearted and mostly used to introduce characters so you reallyyyyy get to know them. Shippuden is much darker and be prepared to take a ride on the feel train cause this has a lot of feels. Even though the story is good what really drew me to naruto was the character development.  Shippuden digs into character development even more which really helps you feel for each character. What I like about naruto is that there is no \"real villian\"  in the series.  Most of the \"villians\"  became that way due to hardships in life.  Which reminds me of when I was in school we read \"The Lord of the Flies.\"  and we discussed the idea if one is simply born evil or if one can simply become evil.  In naruto they play on the idea that everyone is good but sometimes due to events where there is light there is always shadows.  You don't just relate and feel for the \"good guys\"  but for the \"villains\"  as well. Love and Hate is a huge theme throughout  the series. Which plays a big part in who each character is and how they turned out.  Naruto also shows that \"Love conquers all.\"  take the main character Naruto for example; he grew up with the Nine tails living inside him which caused everyone to fear him and avoid him,  which caused Naruto loneliness and hatred but,  with the love he received from others he turned in to the person he is today.  This helps him be able to relate to others and to save them.  One last thing is Naruto has some great battle scenes so prepare for some \"Action Boners!\" one thing I like about some of the battles is that they aren't your typical high action fights with lots of explosions (which there are battles like that)  there are a few fight scenes that are really emotional and even though some fists are shared it is the \"words\"  that do the real damage and those in my opinion are my favorite battles in the series.  I definitely recommend naruto the story is good but the character development is even better.  I am going to end this now since it's starting to turn in to a novel!  I really hope this helps someone out and convinces you to give this a chance!",
    "\n                Now days the anime on everyone's mind is naruto shippuden and it has deserved it. It deserves every bit of praise any one can throw at it. Set in a beautiful setting of Konoha it tells us a story about an ignored boy Naruto who claims to be the greatest ninja of the village(hokage). It maintains the perfect balance of friendship, love, suffering and loss. The writer Masashi kishimoto depicts the tale beautifully. The animation is quite good and the music is awesome. No one can not fall in love with this show. And the characters are pretty cool and powerful like Sasuke Uchiha and\n                  \n\neveryone's fav. Kakashi Hatake. The main protagonist Naruto is pretty powerful but he can be annoying sometimes. His personality is like Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece(but lets face it nowadays everyone is like Luffy ex: Natsu from Fairy Tail). As of fight sequences..they are awesome and depicts how awesome it can be to be a Ninja and that is the best thing because if u can relate to it you love it.",
    "\n                What the haters don't understand is that fillers are not an indication of how good or bad an anime is, atleast not for me, let me just start out by saying that this story is a masterpiece, and it will remain so until the end of time it self, the naruto legacy will live on whether the haters like it or not, now that this series is over, people can watch it without the crappy fillers, some of the fillers are important but most are bad, so you can use an episode guide to figure out which ones to skip, watch this series by skipping\n                  \n\nall the crappie fillers and you will see why this is one of the most popular franchises in history",
    "\n                I have a love-hate relationship with Naruto:Shippuuden. It is slow, very slow. Dragged, very dragged. The flashbacks are insane. I remember them showing us a flashback of an episode (pretty much 12 minutes out of 20 were a flashback). Luckily, I skipped through that. I play the next episode, waiting for stuff to start happening (instead of the flashbacks). But whaddaya know!! The next episode has the SAME FLASHBACK OF THE SAME EPISODE that I JUST WATCHED in the last episode and took ANOTHER 12 MINUTES!!!! Like what the hell, seriously?!?! Can you milk your audience any better?! \n\r\nThe only good thing about this anime\n                  \n\nis the story. The story is extremely interesting. Sad that it was ruined by the flashbacks. Many characters are interesting, but many are just plain awful.\n\r\nSasuke is probably the most annoying character ever, along with Sakura. Sasuke always tend to make the incorrect decision. He never settles, from one stupid decision to the other. He is a villain but no one knows. Even though Sasuke is pure crap and doesn't give a single damn for Sakura, this girl still loves him. He mistreats her so badly it is disgusting. But she still loves him. HOW?!?! \n\r\nThe story was perfect (imo) until the very last arc, which takes up like 300 episodes or something. There was a lot of dragging ongoing in the last arc. But! There was a lot of sudden and abrupt endings. \n\r\nI got bored writing this review so I will stop here. Who cares anyway?",
    "\n                Story- 9/10 \r\nI enjoyed the story of this anime adaptation alot! I mean alot! the manga naruto shippuden that follows on from naruto (prequel). I never read the manga of either naruto or naruto shippuden but after watching the anime i was intrigued mostly every episode and i fully enjoyed watching it. I am not going to pinpoint every tiny detail because the story in general is worthy of 9/10 or even 10/10.\n\r\nart- 10/10 \n\r\nThe evolution of the naruto shippuden art is outstanding to say the least, by just watching the anime openings you see frame by frame how much detail and pure ,beautiful art\n                  \n\nand time the animation studio put into this anime. I don\u2019t even need to say anything to explain why i am giving this a 10/10 so i will leave it at that.\n\r\nSound- 7/10\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good, it was all in sync as it should alot of great voice acting and also great action sound effects. However, i did hear repeated music in some scenes which i did not mind but i also heard some use of the same action sound effects which were quite annoying which is why i am giving it a 7/10.\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\n\r\nThe characters in naruto shippuden were questionable to some but for me i would say most of the characters had good story plot to them and were developed through time and you would able to see that in the series as you progress through different arcs of the anime. \n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 \n\r\nNaruto shippuden has alot of wacky jokes here and there or great plot and even great action scenes. I found it to be very enjoyable 10/10\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is one of the best out there among the top and yes it has its faults but its most likely up to personal preference of what you think of this anime adaptation.",
    "\n                \"In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum, that's true, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.\" What a fun and long winded journey this was, but damn Im glad I experienced it. Last year I was one of few anime fans that never watched Naruto and now Im one of many to have completed the series. The prequel series ended with Naruto leaving his village to train with his sensei Jiraiya in order to prepare for his encounter with the Akatsuki. On the other hand Sasuke joined Orochimaru so he can get stronger in order to kill his\n                  \n\nbrother Itachi. Due to the huge events waiting to come I had very high expectations heading into the sequel. The original was very good series with awesome fight scenes and did a great job on introducing the ninja world to the audience. I was both excited and nervous to see how the series as a whole would conclude hoping it would explore more of the ninja world and some of its characters. Now time to review the long sequel that is Naruto: Shippuden.***contains MINOR spoilers***\n\n\r\nStory:8/10\r\nA great long winded coming of age story with deep themes and lots of depth. The series isn't just about ninja conflict but about people growing up. We see Naruto and his friends go from children to teenagers to grown up in a way that's very satisfying given all the dark moments they go through. Where the story truly excels is its world building. We are given all of the ancient history of the ninja world and it's all greatly expanded upon in the series. We learn all about the villages and great nations on how they look and impact the story and how they all contribute with one another. Pacing issues at times are a problem as there are so many training sequences with Naruto to the point where it got kinda repetitive. The story was also dragged heavily with once again its use of flashbacks and filler. However having seen all the back and side stories really packed an emotional punch that added so much depth to the main plot and in some ways outshined it. The story had several great moments but towards the end made some bad choices during the Fourth Ninja War. Overall the storyline is better than most shonens that Ive seen thus far.\n\r\nArt:9/10\r\nShippuden is a series that when it wants to it looks so damn GREAT. It became noticeable that during the more intense and violent battles of the series it uses different style animation that helps make the movements more fluid. This was done by animator Norio Matsumoto and notable examples of this would be Sasuke vs Deidara and Kakashi vs Obito. However the animation in the series wasn't always great and at times it looked too exaggerated. The most perfect example of this would be Naruto vs Pain where in some shots the fight looks so bad to the point fans made memes out of it. Usually in a long series keeping consistent animation is a hard thing to do and Shippuden does at times suffer from this but thumbs up for the series for not being afraid to use different animation for some of its scenes. Where the series really improve from the original were its editing and use of color palette. There are some views and angles of the series where it just looks downright beautiful that we didn't really get from the prequel. All in all it's the battles scenes where the art truly excels and its one of many reasons why Naruto is considered to have one of anime's most memorable fights. \n\r\nSound:9/10\r\nOne of my favorite things about this series is how memorable most of the quotes are. \"You presumptuously see yourself as the ruling powers, and distance yourself from death. Softened by peace, you've become thoughtless. Kill and be killed. Hatred connects the two.\" All of this was helped by great voice acting by the cast and there's so many quotes to choose from. The music overall is very good. Most of the tracks portraying some of the scenes more intense and emotional moments. Arguably the best track is Pain's theme song \"Girei\" it's a very dark and godly track that perfectly portrays the character. As for the opening and ending themes some were very good but some were okay. My favorite opening would have to be the first one \"Hero's Come Back\" from Nobodyknows. The OST's biggest strength were definitely the background tracks. \n\r\nCharacter:10/10\r\nIt is here where I think the series truly shines. The franchise as a whole is so character driven and really does an amazing job at making us feel for them especially the villains. There are some many characters that have their moments to leave an impression on the audience whether if it's from the use of backstory, interactions, personalities, or abilities. What makes this cast so fun is how much variety they have in their abilities. There are ninja who can spit fire, turn into paper, become giants, heal wounds, take over bodies, you name it and it really helps add joy to the cast as a whole. Character development is also big here as so many people learn and undergo changes from character arcs and make them complete. As with a lot of large casts giving depth to all is very tough and towards the end of the series a lot side characters do get pushed to the back to lead way for Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. It even throws in a villain at the very end with little to no build up and it really didn't help at all. Even so the series does such an amazing job at making most of its cast feel relevant to the storyline.\n\r\nFinal Verdict\n\r\nPros\n\n\r\n+Strong coming of age story with great exploration of deep themes(war, discrimination, vengeance, etc)\r\n+A dominate cast with a surprising amount of complexity and backstory\r\n+Outstanding world building that completely fleshes out the ninja world\r\n+The final battle between Naruto and Sasuke\n\r\nCons\n\r\n-THOSE DAMN FLASHBACKS!!\r\n-Narrative starts to lose momentum as the series progresses\r\n-Fourth Ninja World War\n\n\r\nPersonal Favorites\n\n\r\nCharacter(s): Kakashi, Pain, and Itachi\n\r\nArc: Pain Assault\n\r\nFight: Kakashi vs Obito\n\n\r\nBoy what a long yet legendary series this was. Naruto is a series of highs and lows but its highs really do outshine the lows for the most part. The franchise is an iconic juggernaut with huge merchandise and sales and its hard to find people who haven't heard of it. It has strong storylines, great battles, awesome characters, deep moments, I would have to say that it's w/o a doubt one of the best shonens anime has had yet and it's a franchise that I see myself talking about for years to come.\n\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",
    "\n                I thought I'd write a Naruto review as unlike most Naruto fans I started late. Naruto was one of the first anime I watched, I was 21ish and I LOVED it, watching both series as quickly as possible.  The main issue with Shippuuden is the filler episodes (as I'm sure you've read) but luckily there is an easy fix. https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden I would suggest reading episode descriptions of the fillers to see if you want to give them a shot. Some are super fun, there are a bunch set in the past about Kakashi and Minato and some in the allied war arc are interesting\n                  \n\nand releventish, but of course they are fillers and naruto fillers tend to be on the painful side. My second problem with this series (acknowledging that japan sucks when it comes to representation) was the heteronormativity, at least in Boruto Orochimaru is upfront with being non-binary their son, but the way everyone gets paired off in painful to watch.\r\nWhy I still give this a 9/10 is the thoroughness of character development and the incredible animation and production style.  This world was built with such care that the creators of the anime were able to display an intricate storyline very clearly and in a way that leaves us with the best feeling.",
    "\n                Note: Please watch the original series of Naruto and at least some episodes of Naruto Shippuuden to help you better understand my review. \r\nWell, to tell the truth, it is more like a Sasuke Shippuuden than Naruto Shippuuden... as most of the story (EXcluding the fillers seasons) are centered around the story of Sasuke-Itachi and Sasuke-Naruto. Sasuke gets more action, spotlight and plot & character development compared to Naruto.\r\nSasuke has to endure learning the real painful truth about Itachi... all the while, he has come into contact with all the main villains of the show... name it... he was Orochimaru's student... then he created his\n                  \n\nown dangerous shinobi team... and even formed a pact with the Akatsuki for evil purposes. The Sasuke now is not the Sasuke we used to know before... after being away from Naruto and the rest of Konoha for so long, he has become more powerful and perhaps slightly arrogant\u2026 Besides that, the Sharingan also features heavily in the Sasuke-Itachi story as you will learn more about the Mangekyou Sharingan and the story behind it, most of which is a new and fresh tale regarding the Uchiha clan, naturally involving Uchiha Itachi as well. Moreover, Sasuke\u2019s battles in Shippuuden steals the show effortlessly as he begins to show his new terrifying powers \u2026 the Sasuke-Itachi battle is definitely a must-watch. It kept my heart pounding as they keep using genjutsu (illusion) techniques and the Sharingan. Just awesome, the battle was.\r\nNaruto\u2019s adventure, on the other hand, dulls in comparison. Forget about the fillers and stuff, Naruto is still the same old, same old\u2026 hoping for Sasuke\u2019s return, talking about bonds and friendship. Of course, Sasuke-Naruto is one of the favourites and a touching story but it gets frustrating when every time they try to locate Sasuke, they always fail to find him\u2026 and when they did find him, things start to get emotional (with the flashbacks and all) but Sasuke always manage to beat them and escape again and again. Naturally, Naruto gets disappointed and trains to get stronger than Sasuke\u2026 By the way, the 9 tails demon fox is also featured as the epitome of Naruto\u2019s power, along with a newer and stronger Rasengan. \r\nTo sum it up in a few sentences: (Main points)\r\n Mostly, Konoha is in danger of being destroyed.\r\n Sasuke is the latest bad guy in addition to the current cast of villains.\r\nGood people (from Konoha) and bad people (from Akatsuki) die in battle.\r\nThe tale behind Mangekyou Sharingan.\r\nKakashi and Jiraiya\u2019s past revealed.\r\nNaruto\u2019s friends\u2019 growth (Hinata, Sakura, Rock Lee, Neji and others from Konoha's ninja teams have improved plenty. Gaara as well, he had his own story arc in the beginning episodes).\r\nSasuke\u2019s own team\u2026 Hebi/Taka\u2026 dangerous ninjas hand-picked by Sasuke to form his own team for the purpose of revenge.\r\nMyterious Akatsuki members.\r\nAll in all, Naruto Shippuuden is very enjoyable as all the characters we love are back in bigger, better ways, stronger and cooler-looking even... if not for the slow pacing and mountains of fillers, it definitely would have attracted all the old Naruto fans back.",
    "\n                This is one anime you would not like to miss. Again the cons is at FILLERS. Just skip the fillers and enjoy the action. uh uh don't get the wrong idea! Naruto makes sure you have lots of laugh as well. Even as far as i have seen, some fillers are okay... or rather good.\r\nThe action is good , although the main protagonist is not very intelligent, but is headstrong, strong willed, having never-die spirit; hence does find a way to counter his foes. The emotional scenes are very nicely pictured especially with death of characters (unlike other animes people do die in here; that's\n                  \n\na good thing here). But some scenes have been over-dramatized a lot. Gives a really irritating feeling. But that is like 1% of it.\r\nThe  OST is awesome as well. Fills you up with energy and boosts your testosterone levels at the time of fights, plays really peaceful and warm music at normal times. The suspense is too good as well; you enver know what is gonna come and from where. Naruto shippuuden always will keep on surprising you. Overall it is a must watch for all anime lovers. 10/10",
    "\n                this review is useful if you haven't watched Naruto already\n\r\nso when you think about Naruto and Judging from it's thumbnail, here is what comes to mind:\r\n\"piece of shit Shounen people are falsely hyped about\" \"overconfident MC who never loses and  never gives up\", \"yelling makes attack stronger\" and...\n\r\nunfortunately some of these accusations are true, but let me tell you this: you will enjoy this anime if you are smart\r\nusually when someone hears that they assume this anime is sophisticated and there is a deep message with heavy symbolism, but in here this is not the case\r\nwhat i mean by it is that you have\n                  \n\nto recognize garbage and filler episodes BC there are a LOT of fillers in this anime, this anime with it's prequel could be summed up in 100 episode at Max.\n\r\nthis is what i did and honestly i could enjoy this anime because of that, look at what characters you find interesting and keep watching, for me it was \"Itachi\" and \"Sasuke\" and \"Orochimaru\" and \"Sai\"\n\r\nbut you can find your own, there are a lot of characters with fairly interesting background, sometimes dialogues can be extremely cheesy but you gotta turn your brain off a little,\r\nremember at the end of the day this is Shounen, it's target is teens so you can't harshly criticize this anime\n\r\nbesides Filler episodes there is another problem with Naruto and that's Naruto himself, his character is extremely stupid, people keep saying he has grown up and he is more mature in this one but that's totally fucking false, he is still the same highly optimistic friendship is magic love is the answer piece of shit kind of a character\n\r\nSasuke is literally killing innocent people and Naruto literally says he is my only friend even though he has a lot of frineds, Sasuke couldn't possibly be saved, near the end he starts to become schizophrenic, he literally thinks people are laughing at him and his clan, he is totally beyond saved, and honestly this makes Naruto an asshole because why is he only willing to save sasuke? why not save Orochimaru? or other villains? most of the villains are fallen heroes, nothing makes sasuke special\n\r\n**spoiler**\n\r\nNaruto is so annoying with his friendship crap that near the end sasuke gives the fuck up so that he leaves him alone! \n\r\n**spoiler**\n\r\ni personally got interested in Naruto because of Sasuke, i saw a scene where he tried to kill one of his friend and i was curious to know what has happened to him and the show handles this character quite good, whenever sasuke is present you always want to find out what's going to happen \n\r\nand the show abuses our curiosity to prolong a decent 100 episode anime to 700 episode anime!\n\r\nso to sum up, use skip button, sometimes you might have to skip 30 episode non-stop but don't be afraid and trust you instincts! THEY ARE ALL FILLERS, if it's not related to sasuke it's most likely filler\n\r\nthe funny thing is i would have rated this anime 1 if i have watched this anime completely!",
    "\n                What could I possibly say about this amazing franchise called naruto and naruto shippuden. This anime is great from the music to the characters and the animetion ok overall it has some filler in it but you can skip it so I don't consider it a problem. The reasons I loved this series are a lot. 1 Naruto teaches you never to give up on something you want to achieve that inspired me in some real life moments, 2 the story was fun happy and sad literally naruto could make me cry sometimes or others super hyped or laughing a lot and lastly 3 the\n                  \n\ncharacters. We see naruto and friends get older from kids to teenagers and in the end adults that make me so attached to them at a point when someone die i would feel like I am losing an old friend and now let's talk villains. Akatsuki is a great group of villains they are cool scary and mysterious ( especially \"tobi\") they had so many great members and each on had his own backstory from the tragic and cool Pain and Itachi to Deidara Sasori etc. Now I am gonna close this review saying that YOU should watch Naruto shipuden it is one of the best shonen series and the last fight in the end is really worth it.",
    "\n                This is it. The follow up to the original Naruto. I love this because it shows the young kid i got to know all grown up.\n\r\nyou get a special feeling after seeing a character you like progress in not only his skill but also his mentality and even art. Shippuuden also has a lot of filler but again it works, it builds to the story and is not a waste of time so do watch it, you will learn a lot and enjoy it. overall the art is good, character development is out of this world and again the music composing has a certain way\n                  \n\nof hyping you up OR hit you straight in the feels man.",
    "\n                Naruto: Shippuden is a masterfully crafted Anime.\n\r\nPlot: \n\r\nThe story is absolutely beautiful. You have epic fights combined with deep emotions and unpredictable story changes that will blow your mind. The only critique I could find about the story is that in the anime some parts are described in very simple pictures, f.e. after a character pulled a very cunning move within combat, in order to let the younger audience understand what has happened. But then again I wouldn't want them to miss out on this anime just because they feel it is too complex, so I guess one can overlook this. (It doesn't happen too\n                  \n\noften to be really bothering anyways.) \n\r\nEverything that happens also fits really well into the universe of Naruto, meaning that within this world's reality everything that happens makes sense. \n\r\nIt is also amazing to see the different characters evolve and grow both in maturity as well as in strength. I have even caught myself cheering like a total nerd when a character has learned a new move or went over his own boundaries. However, I feel that the side characters are being neglected in terms of development, since they really can't compete with the main character's strength at all after a certain point. \n\r\nCharacter design:\n\r\nMarvellous. There are dozens of different characters and everyone is unique. Even the side characters have distinguishable features, and the main characters show a character depth that many Hollywood movies could learn from nowadays. \n\r\nLet's take the villain Orochimaru for example. He is easily the most well-designed antagonist I have seen in any motion picture, even in all the books I read I can't find a character like him. Pure evil. Cunning, bizarre and frightening. On top of his unpredictable actions and twisted motives, the music appearing together with him just rounds up the presentation of this character, and to me, makes it unforgettable. \n\r\nMusic:\n\r\nIt's pretty simple: The music in Naruto is incredible. When I showed some of the tracks to a friend who doesn't watch it, even she was amazed. If you don't believe me go to youtube and check some of them out, but be careful, it might lead to you watching the whole series if you haven't already! \n\r\nAnimation:\n\r\nThey did an amazing job animating Naruto. It's really beautiful to see how everything comes to life after reading the manga in black and white, and the animation of Naruto can compete with most recent animated movies. Many scenes are animated so well that you just want to watch them over and over again, especially some of the fights where the graphics and \"camera angles\" really come to shine. \n\r\nAll together, I would give it a 10/10 currently, as the overall experience with this show has simply blown me away and I can't really find anything really bad to say about it.",
    "\n                Imagine yourself inclined on how astounding an episode is, enthralled by the unanticipated twists and exciting battles each episode has to offer, then suddenly, the next thing you know; you'll be watching filler episodes back-to-back that matters not in the plot. The absurd amounts of fillers present in this anime destroyed my experience and annoyed me the most, thus forcing myself to write this spiteful introduction towards Naruto Shippuuden. I can spout more insults that I found ridiculous towards this piece of crap...that's if I didn't enjoy and loved Naruto Shippuuden as an avid anime fan.\n\r\nThe endless amounts of fillers that I've grown to hate\n                  \n\nwere outweighed by the existence of countless amazing things that I've loved about this series, and that, in fact, is why I give this anime a 9/10. \n\r\nI remember buying copies of pirated DVD's in my country just to watch a bundle of episodes of Naruto, which was way back in 2012, and as a child, plot didn't really matter at most. Just the fact that I was able to enjoy and mimic the way the characters act and talk was a good reason for me to love this show. Now that I'm a 17-year old teenager that loves to write his opinions on the Internet, rewatching the whole series itself made it clear that this show I've adored when I was a kid, was still the same show that I've admired.\n\r\nI'll try to be conscious of spilling spoilers, so don't worry about seeing any relevant info that may destroy your experience. I'm just here to give you an insight on the things you'd expect from this show.\n\r\nThe plot follows the story of your typical shonen protagonist, Naruto. Shunned by the villagers because of his nature, his adventure to be acknowledged by the people is a tale of loss and hope that will keep you buckled into your seats. The lore behind the world of shinobi is further explained in the middle part of the series, and it's something that I was able to absorb due to the power of Kishimoto to connect episodes I've seen to a history that led to the current situation. \n\r\nThough the plot wouldn't be pretty much interesting if it weren't for the many memorable characters that appeared on this series, that truly brought forth this series towards its success. Aside from Naruto, the appearance of many great side characters with their past being emphasized in the fillers were interesting enough to keep me hooked to this show. There are so much life lessons that I've learned from them, enough to empathize with them in tragic times. Supporting characters, antagonists, even characters that appeared for only one episode, most of them have unique personalities that keeps the show going. Sure I disliked the fillers, but SOME fillers presented character depth that made my attachment toward the characters stronger, which is why I'm not 100% spiteful towards the fillers.\r\n(You've probably seen some memes saying Sakura is useless - yes she is, but at the same time, she does her job)\n\r\nThe animation quality is I'd say...inconsistent. Some episodes were simply horrid and the characters looked like drawings made by drunken artists, and I'm referring to the fillers and unimportant ones. The main episodes, HOWEVER, were just breathtaking especially the fight scenes and 1 v 1 battles. Including the choreography and details in the animation part, there's a strong impact that only Naruto can deliver when it comes to animation. In terms of battles, the animation is fluid and detailed when I'd watched it slowly. Seeing even the slight movements of arms and being overwhelmed by how well-choreographed the fight scenes were, in addition to the perfect placement of flashbacks and gripping soundtracks, so much emotion can be conveyed and felt as I've immersed myself in what's in front of me. Even airing back on 2007 - 2015, the amount of effort and budget that the developers put in animating the main episodes can be truly noticed. \n\r\nI have nothing to say about the music. SERIOUSLY. With heartfelt and pumping openings such as the infamous Silhouette and melancholic endings, my playlist is filled with songs I've found in the series. The original soundtracks are also worth praising for. Naruto's energizing main theme; Sasuke's Wild West theme, even Itachi's comforting theme - there's so much more OST's Naruto has to offer that complements scenes very well and further strengthens the impact in which a scene can deliver.\n\r\nVoice acting is exceptional too.\n\r\nTo end this review, I'd just like to clarify things to convince you further to watch this show and choose which path to take.\n\r\nI've first started to watch Naruto up to Naruto Shippuuden without missing one episode and trust me, there'll be times you'll get bored as hell especially if you're the ones who manages his/her time, so I'd suggest you to search online what are the episodes that truly matters the most and the fillers that are worth noticing if you are someone who doesn't have all-time in your grasp. I simply rewatched Naruto while having a cheat code of which episodes to watch since I'm now a college student and I've simply wanted to make a genuine feedback on the anime I've loved ever since. Still, partaking in the 800 episodes without missing a single isn't also a bad idea. It develops character depth that enhanced my attachment towards 'some characters that made them truly memorable.\n\r\nSo no matter how many things I found ridiculous in the hundreds of hours I've allotted in watching Naruto, I've enjoyed it genuinely. Kishimoto successfully implanted his life lessons toward myself and I don't regret any bit of it. Hearing the same word \"Hokage Dattebayo\" which means \"I'm gonna be Hokage\" millions of times is quite a nuisance, but I've realized the meaning behind it. The resolve of the characters towards their goal is what I've truly grown fond of, and this resolve was enough for me to keep involving myself in this anime, no matter what others say. \n\r\nSure Naruto is no masterpiece; it's like I said in the first part - it's a piece of crap. But this crap is interesting enough that it left a place in my heart and convinced myself to watch the 800 episodes this title has to offer and complete all the game adaptations. Oddly enough, I found myself attached to people that doesn't even exist. I even cried without realizing the reason behind it. I don't really know it myself, but as long as anime made me shed a tear, it's worthy enough to be praised.\n\r\nAnd thus a strong wind was able to sway one's heart.",
    "\n                Every so often, something comes along that is truly special. Naruto: Shippuuden is one of those very special moments in any type of media that there is nothing wrong with it. Everything in this anime screams masterpiece from the master story-telling to the relatable and down-to earth characters. If you think that the sheer length of the anime is a turn-off, think again, as every minute is worthwhile. One of the main criticisms of Shippuuden is the number of filler episodes which is a criticism I disagree with due to my opinion of every episode being integral to the plot as it shows the main\n                  \n\ncharacter's lighter side. If you haven't seen the whole of Shippuuden, why are you on this site? You are not a true anime fan.\n\r\nNote: A messy haired boy in my class did not understand the complexity of Naruto: Shippuden so I battered him as it was a insult to this masterpiece.",
    "\n                This review is covering Naruto and it's sequel 'Naruto Shippuden' as I view them as inseparable.\n\r\nFirstly, the story is an epic juggernaut. It ramps up and plateaus, ramps up again, takes you off cliff-hangers, makes you cheer, makes you cry. Some may say it is a little drawn out, others may say that there are too many filler episodes but everything adds to the crescendo, making character specific plot points that bit more meaningful. The world building of Naruto is second to none.\n\r\nThe art of Naruto evolved over the many years it was in production, it has many of the most recognisable characters in all\n                  \n\nof anime, and dozens of its fight scenes are just pure, visual ecstasy.\n\r\nThe music in Naruto has more depth than the pacific ocean. It has great music throughout its 700+ episodes that I listen to in my lorry to this day.\n\r\nCharacter development is simply a masterpiece. Untouchable. Not sure how else to put it into words.\n\r\nEnjoyment, again, is unquantifiable. It changes peoples lives, Naruto transcended it's own genre like Muhammad Ali with boxing and Michael Jordan with Basketball.\n\r\nOverall, I can only give a 10 to my favourite anime of all time. Yes 700+ episodes may seem daunting, but it's an experience you will never regret or forget.",
    "\n                (Some minor spoilers up ahead, sorry)\n\r\nAh, Naruto Shippuden! Where do I begin with this anime? I used to be so in denial about Naruto, I used to hate it because of it's notoriously cringy fanbase and the comments about the show that I had heard even though I hadn't watched it. But now that I have finished it, I feel like a new man :D. \n\r\nAlso, I know I'm kind of late on writing a review about this show as it finished about a year ago and there has been a load of reviews about this show, but I felt like I needed to express\n                  \n\nhow I feel about this magical show. And please bear with me, I'm not a pro reviewer or anything of the sort, but I did my best. (Also comment on my profile if you have anything to tell me about this review, it is important to me how people feel about my writing.)\n\r\nLet's begin!\n\r\nStory - 8.5\r\nThe story may seem really simple and stupid at first if you only read the short synopsis of the anime, but to me it is a complex and engaging story with many plotholes, funny moments and lots of emotion, even if it's an anime about ninjas not really being ninjas. I vividly remember just sitting at the edge of my seat or laying in bed buried in blankets just being excited about what was going to happen next. I even watched this show in school when we would get laptops for , well, school work on them. That's how hooked I was. I've also heard a lot of backlash from people about the final arc, the 4th Ninja War arc and I can kind of see why, but I think people are definitely exaggerating over it. Yes the pacing was at it's slowest then. Yes there were lots of flashbacks. Yes, Kaguya was a bad plothole. But at the end of the day, this is also the arc where Madara truly shined as a character, and not just Madara, Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Obito, Guy, the Akatsuki members, Gaara, and many, many more. This is the arc where we got some of the best fights in the whole series. This is the arc when the big, \"evil\" plan of the Akatsuki was revealed. I feel that this arc is mentioned only as a con of the series despite all of the great things it had going for it. This arc is not the best, but it is not the worst and it definitely did NOT KILL Naruto.\n\r\nCharacters - 9\r\nThis anime had some of the best characters the anime medium could offer as a whole. From the strong loser Naruto to the evil but also friendly Obito, these characters are really just unforgettable. Even some of the filler characters are really likeable. Not to mention the villains. I could honestly say that Naruto Shippuden contains my favorite villains I've seen in any show or movie. So why is this section only a 9 then you may ask? Well, its because this series also had a few not so good characters. There's a handful of some I really don't like but I'm going to give you my top 3. Tenten, Danzo and Sasuke. Tenten was just really annoying, Danzo was just an unlikeable lunatic with delusions of grandeur (Basically a worse version of Tobirama) but I think Kishi tried to give him a hidden finesse so he is the one out of these 3 who I dislike the least, and Sasuke, who had potential to be among my favorite characters, but in my opinion he turned out to be the biggest and the most retarded douchebag in the whole series. I honestly don't know why Naruto liked the guy so much. Again, Kishi tried to give Sasuke a lot of finesse and depth, and yes, I admit that he had a very complex development but his ignorance, cockyness and overambitiousness just made me dislike the character.\n\r\nArt - 8\r\nI'm going to be honest with y'all, Naruto Shippuden had really bad animation at the start of the series. It was an upgrade form the original Naruto, but not by a lot. It sometimes felt a bit lazy too, but you must take to consideration that Naruto is a longrunning anime. When watching a longrunning anime, this is a risk you must take. Despite this, most of the fight scenes were fucking beautiful and when the wasn't a fight going on the atmosphere was pretty clean after about 150 episodes. Not Hunter x Hunter 2011 level, but still, pretty damn clean.\n\r\nSound - 10\r\nThis should be pretty freaking obvious. The OST was godly and the most openings and endings were very catchy. My favorite op's were openings 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 and 20 and my favorite ed's were endings 1, 3, 6, 8, 25, 30, 33 and 34. Both the subbed and the dubbed versions are good, but I prefer the sub and thus recommend the sub over the dub even though the series has some of my favorite english voice actors like Travis Willingham, Crispin Freeman and Troy Baker.\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment - 9\r\nThis anime has a really special place in my heart. To me, the story was truly capturing despite being hard to follow at times and having some terrible plotholes. It had some of the best battles in most likely any shounen battle anime I've seen. It's one of the only anime that has actually managed to make me cry, and that's telling something. I truly recommend this anime for everyone who is up for the task like I was, but be prepared, this anime will have some things you might dislike.\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEven though I fucking love Naruto Shippuden and feel like it had a bunch of really good things going for it, Naruto Shippuden is not perfect. The story is slow, it had some bad plotholes and had a lot of flashbacking midway which made the story even slower. And these flashbacks I talked about were for the weekly watchers when the anime was aired on TV, so if you are a bingewatcher like me, this is just another minus. Despite this aspect the story is definitely worth every second of waiting for it to actually bloom. Naruto Shippuden is also obviously an anime which will not end in a shortly since it has 500 episodes, 269 if you count out the filler, holy shit, and 220 original Naruto episodes, again, counting out the filler, 126 episodes. BUT, there are fillers that are pretty important to the main story and I have gathered a notepad which has all of these filler episodes which I like to call \"Half Canon\". The original Naruto only 6 of these episodes and those were 136-141. The Naruto Shippuden \"Half Canon\" episodes were episodes 28, 45, 49, 127, 284 to 289, 316 to 319, 347 to 359, 386, 394 to 413, 416 to 417, 419, 451 to 457, 460 to 461 and 464 to 469. This show may look very scary to start because of the intense amount of episodes, the constant hate this show gets and the other negative things I have mentioned, but at the end of the day, everyone is different, everyone has different tastes and if this review didn't make you feel like watching Naruto Shippuden or Naruto at all for that matter, I guess that's just tough luck.",

    "\n                So, this review contains spiders and spoilers so watch out. This isn\u2019t going to be a spoiler free review, because I feel like I need to talk about specific things in the show to fully explain my opinion and score of it. So if you haven\u2019t seen the show and don\u2019t wanna be spoiled, stop reading. \n\r\nGosh\u2026 where do I start when talking about Naruto Shippuden? If I was to graph the quality of the series as it went on it would look a lot like a sin curve, with a big old dip right at the end of it. The individual arcs are just\n                  \n\nso inconsistent with one another in terms of quality. And for every great arc like the Pain Assult or Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant there is an equally bad thing, such as the seemingly endless, fillerific and boring Fourth Shinobi War arc. \n\r\nI guess if you were to list everything that happens in Naruto Shippuden as either good or bad then the good would potentially outweigh the bad by a tiny bit. But the problem is the bad bits are so bad that they really do drag down the great bits of the show. The show has this incredibly strong fetish for redeeming villains as they die, which I think is fine to occasionally do when it fits, but if you try to do it for every villain, which Naruto has a lot of, then it just feels so damn shoehorned. For example, Pain was an amazing villain and the two arcs with him as the major bad guy are some of the greatest anime episodes I have ever watched. It was tense, there was death, character arcs and consequences and Naruto\u2019s fight with him truly was his graduation into being a fully-fledged hero after so long. Then when he was defeated Pain just decided to become good for poorly explained reasons and brought back everyone he had killed besides one person back to life. Effectively ruining and retconning most of the good stuff he as a villain did. And for what? To make you feel bad for the guy that just spent the last 20 episodes being ninja Stalin? Scenes like that just reverse half an arc really paint a picture that this story really wasn\u2019t planned out very well, if at all. \n\r\nAnd that ending\u2026 it honestly goes against fundamental storytelling basics. To briefly explain it, after flip flopping between major villains like it was going out of style, it looked like Madara Uchiha would be it, the big baddie was finally settled. They managed to set it up so that he was the mastermind and cause of almost everything evil in the plot, from the nine-tails attack to the actions of most of the other major villains to the death of the girl that turned Obito into an evil person. They made him complex, making him not specifically evil, he just wanted everyone to not have to suffer like he did and have a blissful, perfect life. His plan had even succeeded, and only Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and Sakura were awake to stop him. And he had basically become a ninja god and is ready to unleash his full power on them. Then\u2026 he just is killed and replaced by someone we had heard about once beforehand. No foreshadowing about it, the villain the show had spent so long building up had been swapped with some random woman that was purely evil with vague motivations who is pretty quickly dispatched of. What was the point of that? To extend this crap even further? \n\r\nAs for the fillers, well to be fair to they are better than the filler bits from the original Naruto, which were painful. Yeah it isn\u2019t amazing television but filler arcs like the Three Tails one could be decent enough time wastes, and seeing the fillers flesh out some of the backstory of the world was nice. But the repeated flashbacks are a huge issue, I swear some of them were repeated like once an episode at some points. If I hear Obito say his stupid line about ninjas who abandon others being scum once more I think I might try to eat my desk. \n\r\nThere is also a big problem with the side characters in that most of them are at points interesting but by the end of the show they are cast aside so that the show can focus just on Sakura, Kakashi, Naruto and Sasuke. And apart from Kakashi all of the main good guy characters are all just kinda\u2026 boring and bland. Except for Sasuke, he is just terrible and dumb. I get that in a series with as many side characters as Naruto you can\u2019t focus on all of them but seeing characters like Sai get so much work done early on in the series to make him somewhat interesting just to be completely ignored by the end is unsatisfying. But that sums up the problem with Naruto, it takes one step backwards for every single one it takes forward. It has so much promise and goodness, then it has a bunch of lacklustre stuff and badness to follow it up. \n\r\nIf I am being honest, Naruto Shippuden is enjoyable. There is enough good stuff and enough great stuff to entertain you, especially the bits directly from the manga. But if you are like me you will get frustrated watching it. It has the big problem where if a little more planning, polish and forethought was put into it then you would seriously have one amazing series. But the imperfections build, and they only get more and more noticeable as the show goes on. Heck I have barely spoken about the plot. But that is because the plot is hard to explain. Whilst not confusing it just goes all over the place, which isn\u2019t at all helped by the constant passing of the \u2018main bad guy\u2019 torch. \n\r\nAnd I hope I am not sounding too harsh with this review, because I don\u2019t hate this show. I want to like it, because I remember sections of it like the Team 10 vs Hidan and Kakuzu fight or the Jiraiya vs Pain battle and really want to like it. But then I remember the niggling problems that bubble and build up as the show goes on, so I can\u2019t give it a higher rating than a 5. I mean the soundtrack is at least pretty damn great. Give it a go but don\u2019t be surprised if you end up hating it for its flaws.",
    "\n                After watching this show I realized if I hadn't watched this, I would have missed an outstanding story. Being a grown-up, at first I didn't like it, but as the story went deeper and deeper into the center part, I started liking it.\r\nFirst of all, the main difference between Naruto and Shippuden is the darker tone, the maturity in shippuden. The whole Naruto and Shippuden was about Naruto wanting to become hokage, and more powerful than Sasuke so that he can bring him to the right path. I love Naruto's cheerfulness throughout the story, though in Shippuden he becomes more serious and more powerful also.\r\nIn\n                  \n\nthe story, once Kakashi told one of Naruto's special abilities was to make friends with anyone he meets, this trait of him makes him more powerful. Akatsuki, the moon plan, mystery behind Tobi's mask, the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, all of this make me love this show. The first half was all about the foundation that Kishimoto laid for us to walk on, and in the Shippuden he digs into the core of the story.\r\nThere are tons of emotional moments in this series, that sometimes make you laugh, some that make you really angry, and some make you cry with them. Of course, the art is much better than Naruto, Shippuden has a lot attention to character details, their outfits, and it has become more colorful and the character movements are better drawn which feels more realistic to me.\r\ni would like to say that it has some truly brilliant fight scenes animated. The 'taijiutsu' scenes are so perfect in character movements and it didn't overlooked the physics too. One of the best fight scenes to me was Naruto vs Sasuke in the first half.\r\nIn Naruto and Shippuden both Kishimoto tried his best to tell almost all character stories being not focused in Naruto only. All characters have their own backgrounds and special personalities, they all feel like real people and they grow throughout the series.\r\nAt some point, when Sasuke becomes evil and still Naruto wants to bring him back home, many people will call this as 'gay' nature of Naruto, but this isn't true.\r\n\u201cThey say wherever someone is still thinking of you, that place is your home.\u201d -Jiraiya | Naruto. This is one of some marvelous quotes from this series. I think this is why Naruto never stalls to think about Sasuke whom he saw as his elder brother.\r\nBut there is a warning. Before you start watching this series you have to know the use of fillers. Fillers are not part of the main story, they are to support the writer to keep up with the pace of the anime. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of manga. When the anime goes too far, to buy some time for the writer, they make use of fillers. Some fillers contain good fights, but you can skip them, it won't hamper your enjoyment with the story.\r\nNaruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wants to become hokage not knowing how hardship it requires, to a serious, hardworking loyal friend who not only wants to save his friend but also the whole shinobi world from the never-ending cycle of hatred and despair. I enjoyed the series and I bet you will do too.",
    "\n                All I have to say is that Naruto Shippuuden is one of the best Animes you'll ever see. A lot of people disagree, either because they're hipsters who try to dislike anything that's popular, because of it being popular, or, because shonen is mostly for young boys and they're under the distorted conception that anything for kids is crap. I mean, other than the fillers and poor animation, the Anime is of a very, very high standard; not many other Animes have such in-depth characters as for example Itachi Uchiha. Nor are many other Animes able to convey, and bring out from you, the levels\n                  \n\nof emotion that this Anime does. Seriously, it is GOOD. Especially the episode I just watched that made me want to express how good of an Anime Naruto Shippuden actually is. Seriously..... I really do hate how this is a 7/10 here. I get it, the filler and animation are bad, but the amazing story makes it all worth it.",
    "\n                A series that has filler, emotions and one of the best intros and outros for the otakus and enthusiasts.\n\r\nNaruto is a series which has romance, beautifully executed fight scenes and interesting plot developments.\n\r\nIf you have already watched the OG Naruto - you will realise that this has more character development for characters such as Hinata Hyuuga , Neji Hyuuga, Shikamaru Nara and more than ever - Sasuke Uchiha!\n\r\nThe scientific logic in shonen series was never relatable, but the fight scenes make it worth a shot in any scenario - such as the fight between Naruto v/s Pain, Guy v/s Madara, Obito v/s Naruto and Sasuke,\n                  \n\nNaruto v/s Sasuke and many more.",
    "\n                Well this time I'm writing an anime without being a fanboy or anything like that, to be honest I once dropped Shippuden in its 50's but I caught up about 300 episode in 2 weeks,and I'll be honest this 7  could be 9 if not the characters and the Art (the animation as well).\n\r\nStory : I think most of all know what it's about , a teenage orphan who wants to be a hokage the strongest ninja in the village etc.. Yep this is a predictable mainstream shonen so don't expect some original mindblowing things in the story, however it has its good points\n                  \n\nand bad points.Let's start with the good ones, naruto has its own pace, its charm that makes you love it, and no matter what score you give to this show , you love its simple story about the kid naruto and his adventures and misadventures. Also the fights are quite epic and exiting , getting to the bad points, the fillers, Omg the fillers, I won't talk about it more.7/10\n\r\nCharacters : Now getting to this point , the characters in naruto is one of the very very weak points. Most of them are useless , and apart from Naruto and probably Sasuke the development isn't really present , most of the characters are used to help naruto or to be in opposition to him finally to get by his side in the end of the arc or the fight etc.. 5/10\n\r\nArt/Animation : Okay this point is really weak too ,an 8 for the art ,  Gj kishimoto , and the animation mm it's a 2/10 yeah I don't like it at all , Bj studio pierrot. so it's a 5/10.\n\r\nSound : Nothing to say , good ost, good openings , aand good endings.\n\r\nEnjoyment : Now the best point of naruto , nobody can deny that this anime will have you sitting in front of te screen for hours without caring about any shit in this world in the beginning of the summer I watched about 300 episodes in 2 weeks ( already said it lol ) and that shows ust how much I enjoy this shonen stuff.\n\r\nOverall : So as an enjoyable anime with its good and bad points I would recommand it to everyone even if you hate it or you don't like watch it it's probably worth your time. (7*2 +5(characters)*2 + 10 * 2 + 5 + 9)/8 = 7.25 \n\r\nSo it's a 7.",
    "\n                        Contrary to the opinion of a big number of fans I believe that Naruto Shippuden was better than original series. The story may not have foreshadowing like One Piece or symbolism like the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter but it is still amazing and in my opinion it has the best fights. Every big battle contains a high level of intensity, strategy and creativity and that includes the final arc which everybody criticizes without realizing that even after the power level of the characters grew, they are still using their heads.\r\nMy favourite part about the\n                  \n\nstory is that unlike other anime/manga from the battle Shounen category, Naruto Shippuden features the adventures of two main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, as they reach closer to the final stage they will share. Basically it's like watching two different anime at the same time. The main theme of the story is pain and how can we reach to understand each other by understanding each others pain. Besides that the arcs which show us the events from the past and how the world reached to be like this feel just like a history book, not a boring one from school, but one full of action which keeps surprising you till the end.\r\n         Some people will most likely say that this anime is not worth watching because of the huge number of fillers which are not even as good as the ones that other big Shounen have. Even though this review is supposed to be about Shippuden I feel responsible to say that the fillers from the original series are awesome. The first anime material I have watched and what convinced me to watch anime in the first place were those fillers. Some of them were just as funny as Gintama and One Piece and it would be a waste to skip them. As for the fillers from Shippuden I must admit that they are not that great, but I still liked them because they gave some characters the screen time that they deserved. And I don' know if naming some arcs is considered spoiler (hope not), but the fillers which show us Kakashis and Itachis pasts are so well made that I consider them canon. And the filler arc about Naruto and a few other characters travelling with a boat in order to reach an island from the land of lightning(an event which is canon) was again extremly funny. And if you are that stubborn that you don't even wanna give those fillers a chance you can just skip and you will still have more than 200 episodes to watch, after all there are people who would say that even 70 episodes is too much.\r\n         The artstyle used by Masashi Kishimoto is one of my favourites and the only part which is not perfect about it is the pretty plain hair. As for the animation, it may not be Madhouse level, but that doesn't make the anime less enjoyable. The soundtrack is also amazing being able to bring every emotion from sadness and despair to anger and excitement to its peak.\r\n          Unfortunatly some of the main characters have not received enough development, but there are also lots of characters with such great backstories, roles, and well developed personalities that I can honestly call them some of the best characters ever created in the history of anime and manga. Even the less developed characters have matured after the timeskip and evolved without loosing their personalities. \r\n         In coclusion Naruto Shippuden is a great anime which I highly recommend to not only the Shounen lovers, but also to the other kinds of fans and it still remains my favourite after watching over 60 different anime from all the genres.",
    "\n                the reason why I love this anime Naruto resolve the problem with not to fight all out. but with talking.and pierrot has adopted naruto manga became an anime serie very well. was broadcast as many as 461 eps in tv tokyo.do not you see? the frame of animation is very soft for this animation with the total of hundreds episodes like now.while fairy tail with the total of hundreds episodes is not as soft as naruto.we should thank to studio pierrot.do not you remember the epic episode?\r\nshikamaru,kakashi,ino,kiba vs kakuzu and hidan.\r\nitachi vs sasuke\r\nteam sasuke vs killer bee\r\nnaruto kyuubi vs pain\r\nchiyo and sakura vs sasori\r\nkakashi vs\n                  \n\nobito\r\ngeneral that epic scenes only for animation totaling around 20 or 13 episodes.and studio pierrot made hundreds episodes of naruto shippuden with a very soft quality\r\nminato dan kushina vs kyuub (sad scene)\r\nand before the death of itachi. the frame of animation its so soft.\r\n.we should thank to the animators at studio pierrot, because they have made this animation frame is so very soft. even the A-1 pictures studio who mad fairy tail with hundreds eiposdes it is not soft as naruto. just see a simple simple movement like walking and hitting and you\r\nYou will know the difference between fairy tail and naruto.if you're an 2D traditional animator you will really understand the difference. you have to watch anime about how to making anime ''shirobako''.the core of all I mean is pierrot studio has adapted Naruto animation with quality as good as the animation of numbered a dozens episodes. although Naruto has hundreds eps now. imagine how many frames are created by the animators?\r\nand this is not about a comparison between the story of fairy tail and naruto.it's about the quality of the animation movement. you have to watch anime about how to making anime ''shirobako''. if you're an 2D traditional animator you will really understand the difference.",
    "\n                Ever since I was a kid I have followed this, and it's always been my very favorite. But I think you need to watch Naruto before you start on Shippuuden as it carries a lot of backstory over. \r\nShippuuden has a lot of fillers here and there but in the long run it's worth it for me. Some fillers are okay, they actually add story to a lot of characters, others are just horrid and pointless. In a sense it adds a lot of tension and build up to the main story. \r\nIt will not shy away from death either in the characters, which is\n                  \n\npersonally one of my very favorite things about this show. I can't stand it when people survive miraculously by some freak-cause. \r\nOverall I highly recommend this anime. Maybe skip the fillers at most.",
    "\n                Naruto is the franchise that will always have a special place in my heart. And no, it is not the nostalgia bias of the fact that it's been on the screen for over 15 years. I used to be one of the guys who were making fun of the show before even watching a single episode, just by looking at the cover and supposing stuff. Before jumping to the critical assessment, I would like to say a few words about how this creation has helped me in so many ways, besides offering so much enjoyment. \r\nAfter surviving a terrible experience which literally has almost killed\n                  \n\nme, I started to feel empty and I completely forgot who I am. Due to being bored I decided to give a shot to this show. It didn't impress me that much straight away, but after a long time, it made me finally feel something in the very first episode. I cannot describe the whole process detail by detail, and it wasn't easy at all, but after more than a year I feel like myself again. It wasn't only about watching the show, it was the fact that the show gave me hope and helped me find the courage to start living again. I went to the craziest journey of my life, studying in a foreign country and I just successfully finished my first year, doing what I love. The way Naruto represents our raw reality with all the harsh elements and feelings in such a positive way is absolutely magical and I cannot describe using words how much that meant for me and how grateful I am. I will do my best to not allow my words to get biased at all and provide you with an appropriate review.\n\r\nNaruto has first appeared on the western screens at the beginning of the XXI century, 2002 till 2007, where the story will transit to the new series, Naruto Shippuuden. The latter is the most exciting part of the story and contains the biggest amount of findings and the crazy action we are all rooting for. It is also offering us a proper ending to the primary plot of the story. The two series are made up of 720 episodes(about 300 fillers, most of them enjoyable) and there are 10 separate movies to watch besides, plus a considerable amount of OVAs. All of them are adapted after Masashi Kishimoto s manga and the few graphic novels he's created.\n\r\nStory(10): Naruto is the story of a little goofy boy who has always been alone and who decides that he will make people accept him and his power by becoming the Hokage(the strongest ninja in the village). His parents are dead, and almost everyone in the village hates him because of the monster that has been sealed within him. One day, somebody finally accepts him and a bond is being created between the two. That is just the beginning, as Naruto is willing to do his best and overcome every obstacle, to achieve his dream, never giving up on his precious smile that will leave a mark everywhere he goes. Is he going to achieve that dream? It's up to you to find that out by watching his journey. The world of shinobi is slowly attracted to war as a mysterious organisation called Akatsuki is threatening the world through its actions. It is a story about overcoming pain and hatred, a story about development and sacrifices, a story about the importance of friendship and dedication. The story of the boy who has promised since long ago that he is never going to go back on his word because that's his ninja way. All of these presented in a very well structured fictional world which contains plenty of secrets to be revealed. There is also the chakra system, a power that has got its own story as well, a power that can be used in combat by shinobi who are using the specific hand signs. Even though this element sounds very science fiction, or might even sound childish, the world is very reality-like. Different lands governed by chosen leaders and military systems. This world isn't hiding the harsh truth and the atrocities that are being committed throughout the story and all people actually have real personalities and interests. Everyone is aware of the danger and the sadness that is being spilt alongside with the blood of the shinobi. I would describe this whole story and the fictional universe as an explosion of feelings. What makes this story so great is the deep way in which it is presented to us.\n\r\nThe structure of the show(8): This is made up by the storytelling and the way the events are structured throughout the show.\r\nThe storytelling leaves no expectations as everything is presented in the most enjoyable order with additional flashbacks, which help you to understand better the reasons behind an action or a result. You're not missing any of the great battles that happened in the past since all of them are being shown at the right time, and will make you feel lucky for not seeing it before.\r\nWhen it comes to the way the events are introduced, there is a problem with the big amount of fillers. Most of them are enjoyable, representing short breaks from the real deal, introducing you extra stuff that happened in the past, extra build-up, extra missions and sometimes parodies. The problem is when the fillers are being introduced right after an epic moment that cuts your breath. Just imagine seeing the most crucial battle and the next episode is a parody that slashes all of your hype down. I recommend you to skip the 376 and 377 episodes when you get there, you can watch them later, after you properly watch the whole important thing. Also, a few important events are being adapted into movies and OVAs and you need to be aware of that in order to not lose any information before proceeding further.\n\r\nCharacters(10): This fictional universe is filled with all sorts of characters that demonstrate their importance at some point. We get character development for almost everyone. Characters can jump from being a fan favourite to being hated by the audience and then jump back into their old shoes. Characters can and do change throughout the series, demonstrating that everyone can fall in the darkness and also that it is never too late to accept your mistakes and start all over again. And then we have the character Naruto, who is doing his best to break through everything he encounters without forgetting his promise and the people in his life. Every character has got a story to tell and stuff to teach, and we are exploring their lives in deep detail, revealing their reasons, their motivations, their aspirations, and so you easily come to an understanding of the character beyond the terms good and evil, breaking through the illusions.\n\r\nVisuals and animation(10): Since the anime starts pretty long ago, it is obvious that the old graphics will seem a bit uncool at the beginning, but as the show is proceeding, the art becomes much more appealing to the eye, even tot he point where you'll fall in love with the visuals. The Kishimoto style has totally impressed me. \r\nSame development with the animation, which is sick in battles and very smooth. Together, they are bringing this wonderful universe to life on our screens in the most appropriate way.\n\r\nSound(10): There is no contest here. Naruto OSTs are the best I've ever heard in anime and not only. The music selected for the openings and endings is always on point with the animations and with the story progress. You're gonna have lots of new material for your playlist. Japanese music is sick. In concordance with everything this show is promoting, there is absolutely no contest when we are talking about the sound of Naruto. OSTs that are gonna make you weep while experiencing the lonely life of Naruto or the death of an important character that you loved. OSTs that will turn battles into the straight fire. OSTs that are gonna make you smile with confidence when against all ods the sun is rising again. \n\r\nEnjoyment(10): I guess there's no need to add any comment here. If you can deal with the fillers, you are experiencing the best out of this incredible journey. I've never enjoyed an anime or a film as much in my whole life. It has also taught me how to enjoy my own life in the real world, which is pretty similar if you're able to make an analogy. I can proudly affirm this creation has saved my life.\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!",
    "\n                If you haven't watched Naruto before Naruto shippuden you might still get the plot but the feeling will not be the same, so i highly recommend you to watch Naruto to get the full experience of the path to your ninja way.\n\r\nAnyway, the story and most of the plot twists are extremely interesting but first you need to get through some occasional fillers that really did frustrate me though i think they were worth it as when the time came for the episode (non-filler) it gave me so much adrenaline all the way throughout the 20 minutes. I also liked that not all episodes were\n                  \n\nserious and manged to give off a funny vibe to them making it quite enjoyable and making it possible for us to see a different side to the characters.\n\r\nThe animation was fantastic and you could see that they actually spent a lot of thought and time in making the fight scenes. I also personally very liked the character design as it wasn't too much so that all the attention is taken off the plot and just towards the character and not too little so that you can't work out who the main characters are... In addition, all the antagonists had a very decent back-story to why they became like that and this is why my favorite character is Uchiha Itachi (not going to give any spoilers on him so i'll just leave it at that)\n\r\nNow the sound. The sound...what can i say... the sound and all the openings are defiantly something that i rarely skipped. But the very first opening of Naruto Shippuden is still something i sometimes listen to as i don't think i will ever binge watch this anime because it took me about two months, something i do not and never will regret.",

    "\n                Naruto is the most amazing anime ever, I didn't regret watching it,  really interesting and every episode makes me excited to continue watching and go on to find out what's gonna happen \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03. The fights are really amazing and you can feel your own heart beats when you watch it, and feel so excited and want to join them \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \"that's a childish dream \ud83d\ude02\",  absolutely amazing and you will enjoy, only the bad thing about Naruto sihppuden is \"fillers\" it was really annoying when you want to know what is gonna happen and the studio instead of continue the anime with manga,\n                  \n\nthey making fillers,  and that was too bad,  but for me I started it when manga was already finished, but anime still airing till 477 episode, so I didn't faced the fillers and kept going,  some of these fillers are worth to watch, and I will watch it. A bad thing or to me I didn't see it as a must to happen was the final battle, after you watch the 4th great ninja war maybe will find that it wasn't necessary to.make a battle between Naruto and Sasuke,  I didn't liked it, and the fight was exactly like Naruto part 1 when Sasuke left and Naruto tried to stop him, I didn't enjoyed as I was expecting. But in the end still my fav long anime series and believe me you'll enjoy watching it,  hope a nice day for you and go watch Naruto sihppuden",
    "\n                story-10\r\nThe story of Naruto Shippuden for me is one of the best written shounen anime out there. The naruto story makes use of a lot of great symbolism and foreshadowing. one thing that makes the naruto anime much better than most other shounen anime is the fact that the story is unpredictable and has many plot twists. the only major downside to the naruto shippuden anime is the fact that is has 219 filler episodes this is about 44% of the series and with the filler not being very good it is enough to put people of from watching the series. one thing the naruto\n                  \n\nseries does brilliantly is make the viewers like the villains of the series and most people will even agree with their philosophy and their take on the world. the show dives into many different themes such as human instinct, self sacrifice, the cycle of hatred and discrimination, the naruto series handles these themes very well.\n\r\nCharacters-10\r\nThe characters in the naruto shippuden anime is one of its biggest selling points with the majority of the cast being great well written characters that most of the fans really like. each character in the series is very unique and this is something that kishimoto does brilliantly as most of the cast's philosophy's differ from one another. the villains in the story are very unique as they aren't evil just for the sake of it. the villains all have their own unique philosophy's in the naruto series. characters like Itachi and Kakashi are some of the best written characters in anime.\n\r\nArt/Animation-8\r\nthe animation in naruto shippuden is very consistent and is pretty good. but the art style is decent but its pretty simple and sometimes it lets down the great animation of the series, an example of this is the naruto vs pain fight as it was animated very well but let down by the art work for it. but overall the art and animation of naruto is good\n\r\nSoundtrack-10\r\nthe soundtrack in the naruto series is top tier, the majority of the cast has amazing themes and the general ost for the series is great as the music goes well with whats happening in the show. the ost allows the anime to show the emotions it wants too because of this.\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment- 10\r\noverall naruto shippuden is a very fun and enjoyable experience as it has so many great elements to it, its a very emotionally attaching series as most people that watch the series get drawn to the characters. i think this show is very good and i would highly recommend it. it is great in both dub and sub but its a better experience in sub.",
    "\n                This is one of the most inspirational,motivational,emotional and enjoyable anime ever made.Better than the original series,Naruto Shippuden initially deals with Naruto and Sasuke's reunion.With this as the main motive,the series progresses through unveiling of many dark secrets and the history of the supporting characters.But after episode 216,the story takes a different turn.Although Naruto and Sasuke did not become friends till then,there was another tale of ten tails and sage of six paths.The story initially becomes interesting but now it is becoming boring and boring as it progresses very slowly.The manga is finished already but the anime will atleast take 1-1.5 years to finish along with\n                  \n\nfillers from now.Story is pretty good as there is a sudden turn of events and there appears some overpowered characters.Though the fillers ruin the story and from episode 427 to now the fillers are going on.If there is one canon episode there are 2/3 fillers.This is ridiculously boring.So,Story is 8/10 for the slow progress in the later episodes.\n\r\nArt\n\r\nArt and animation is one bad part of the anime.Naruto shippuden's art is better than naruto but still it is an average one.though it is a bit sad to see such a good anime with bad art but still this part of the anime deserves 7/10 from me.\n\r\nSound\n\r\nOne of the strong parts of the anime.The sound and music of shippuden is fantastic.It just blows out of my mind when i remember shippuden's background music.The emotional scenes are showed with such emotional tone that it is heart aching.10/10 for sound.\n\r\nCharacter\n\r\nThe best part of the anime.All characters are unique in their own way and almost none of them looks boring (sometimes it looks though).Best character in the whole anime is itachi uchiha and then naruto,kakashi,pain,killer bee.Itachi's character is just unforgetabble.All others are also very good except some(in my opinion)-Raikage,Mizukage,Sasori,Kiba and some.But still it deserves 9/10.\n\r\nEnjoyment\n\r\nOf course, i enjoy.If it is asked that do you enjoy naruto shippuden i think it is a silly question.(i'm not including fillers) The fights are amazing with some twists and the taijutsu is the most fascinating.Best fighter in naruto according to me is shikamaru.Just brilliant fight with hidan.I wished he could have fought more in the anime.Enjoyment is 10/10.\n\r\nOverall-9/10\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden is a very good and interesting anime that you must watch.The complain about fillers is just unacceptable.Fillers are being broadcasted.Simple-Just don't watch them.I've  watched some of the fillers and i came to know that fillers doesn't even have 1% relation with the story.It is just set in the middle of arcs,So i don't watch nowadays.Just be patient.Keep yourself informed about the next episode whether it is a filler or canon.That's the simple way.If you cannot wait for 1 week or 2 week or sometimes 2/3 months then how can you watch the bbc series sherlock???Naruto Shippuden is a very underrated anime.It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth watching as it is very much thrilling and enjoying to watch",
    "\n                As Naruto leads into Naruto: Shippuuden I found that the story line became more focused and interesting. Far more character story lines are revealed where as before in Naruto it was mostly \"oh he's a ninja of the leaf\" and that's the most you got.\n\r\nOne massive pain with Naruto though is that episodes are dragged out, filled with flashbacks and long stare downs during battle scenes. There are also groups of 10-20 filler episodes within the main plot were ninja go on random missions. Maybe the creates just wanted to hit the next 100 episode mark... It's just not needed.\n\r\nIf you can look past all\n                  \n\nof this though the story line and teachings of Naruto are very good, this is the main reason I continue to watch. Along with the lovable characters, animation and art work.\n\r\nOverall Naruto: Shippuuden shows great improvement in story and character building which is why I scored it an 8.",
    "\n                Time for my review of the day.\n\nNaruto Shippuden is not that bad of an anime. Some people would disagree with me, and to be perfectly honest, I prefer short anime (100-) since most of them just so happen to have a better storyline (even so I wish they were longer) than the longer ones (not just saying Naruto Shippuden, but some of the longer ones seemed a bit boring sometimes), however, that does not mean I did not enjoy this anime. I recommend this anime to you if you like fighting/supernatural anime.\n\nFor the story, I give this anime an eight out of ten. I could\n                  \n\nkeep up with the story, but the anime is filled with so much fillers that it still managed to throw me off from time to time.\n\nThe art was well done, and at some points in the anime, it seemed more realistic. Ten out of ten.\n\nThe characters' voicing and overall sounds, I would give it an eight out of ten.\n\nThe characters themselves\u2026 I didn't really like the characters that much. There are a few in which I've enjoyed, such as Itachi, one of the characters in the anime, but overall, I would give this section a six out of ten.\n\nI was enjoying myself almost throughout the entire anime, but the fillers seemed to be a bit boring sometimes. Eight out of ten.\n\nAll and all, I would give this anime an eight out of ten. I recommend this anime to you guys if you've enjoyed Bleach or Fairy Tail.",
    "\n                Oh my God, this anime is 45% fillers (which means that it is not in the Manga), so it a waste of time. Oh even if most of the fillers is basically backstory, or side mission, I like to call them.\n\r\nYo, I am The Self-proclaimed Idiot, and that was my take on being sarcastic. In this review I will answer the hard hitting questions, for example, Do I have to watch the fillers? Is the art really $h!t, because that episode with pain face make me believe it like that all the time? Is it just me or the all shounen anime have plot armour?\n                  \n\n\n\r\nStory (10/10): This is an anime about a boy trying to get recognized by his peer. Oh, vague. Hard hitting question #1: No you do not need to watch the fillers, but I recommend it. You play games like Skyrim, Fallout, and Gta. And you telling you don't play the side mission. You are losing out on content or backstory when you don't watch the Fillers. This story is literally an adventure. It is also a roller coaster of emotion. You will laugh a little and cry a little. But to me that is what make an anime great.\n\r\nArt (9/10): Hard hitting questions #2: Because you see what some people think is a mistake the degrade animation of its beauty. Me, a least think the art style fit beauty even the fight with Pain. \n\r\nSound (10/10): I loved every opening and ending song. Voice acting fit every character perfectly.\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): Every main character and antagonist had backstory (hint: watch the fillers)\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Did feel a little bit of slow paced, but okay.\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Don't have to watch the fillers, but do. A little slow paced. Amazing song. Beautiful artwork. There might be some down sides to this anime, but you have to find them yourselves.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuuden takes a nice shit on the Naruto series. Even if you take away all the filler, the core material completely eradicates the main message of the original series. Naruto was supposed to be about a child who was not gifted and he attempt to follow his impossible dream. But Shipuuden takes the typical shonen route and makes the story about a chosen boy who must save the world. This is not a good series, most characters are back seated for Naruto, and though it has its good moments, the series took a huge nose dive. The story follows the end of Naruto, and\n                  \n\nnow Naruto wants to save Sasuke and defeat the Akatsuki, while the Akatsuki look interesting at first, the story starts to unravel into a huge \"this was all apart of my plan!\" type theme. Where the evil genius keeps being trumped by another evil genius. Naruto's character changes for the worst, sakura looks as if she is going to become an actual decent character but that is shit on. Kakashi is decent along with shikamaru but eventually every character becomes a narutard, also known as a character that falls in love with naruto and just spouts out naruto like messages, this turns their characters into naruto clones. The villains were interesting, and they would be good if the series stopped using the whole \"He was just like Naruto, except he could not be happy\" type theme, it became an in series cliche. The art was eh at many moments, yet the music was good. So I was NOT look at this series, instead if you want some shonen in your life go READ one piece, as the anime has become visual garbage. also soul eater should take care of your anime fighting craving, and it is short as well.",
    "\n                I've loved Naruto, me and him were born the same year, so I like to call this my Birth anime.\n\r\nThe message from Naruto:  this anime is very motivational and has taught me valuable lessons to life such as loving for others and to do my best no matter what and will always hold a place in my soul\n\r\nThe Characters to me I could always picture myself relating to each one heck sometimes i forget that it's an anime and I begin to think I am inside of it myself (when I'm watching it not all the time)\n\n\r\nThe soundtracks: Wonderful. I have downloaded quite a\n                  \n\nbit of them onto my phone because that's how great they are to listen to! I'd suggest looking up the soundtracks yourself.\n\r\nThe art work: Why I'm gonna complain about this, is because closer to the end like episode 400 the developers were starting to get lazy and make mistakes that highly stick out. Like when Minato was reanimated they put his actual eyes instead.\n\n\r\n                                         If you want an anime to relate yourself to, pick this one. Trust me it is great, no matter what those DBZ boys say.",
    "\n                The only thing this show had going for it was the Pain arc, it was a good tragedy and delivered on the promise that Naruto would one day become a strong ninja. After that, the show really falls flat.\n\r\nThe main problem stems from the Great War Arc being so long (equivalent to 200 chapters worth of material). Stuff is cluttered, different plot points are tangled and new major villains come out of nowhere. There are something like 4 main villains in this arc, and each one becomes irrelevant when the new one shows up. The arc builds up one antagonist and then tosses it away,\n                  \n\nthereby destroying the point of the antagonist in the first place. And in the end, you're just left with a Sasuke vs. Naruto fight squeezed in for the sake of it providing closure, when in fact this fight could've just happened after the Pain arc and have had way more significance.\n\r\nAside from story shortcomings, the animation is some of the worse I've ever seen. Even Hunter X Hunter, which had around 150 episodes, had amazing animation, so I don't see long runtimes posing budget issues for the animation. There are some decent characters (Kakashi, Pain, Gai, Rock Lee, etc...) but they are few and far between, and almost every character is tossed aside so that Naruto and Sasuke can have the spotlight in the last arc. \n\r\nOverall, the show is overhyped and cliche. The 'main' antagonist Sasuke doesn't even show up a lot, and when he does he is just bland and plain edgy. The only high point of the show would be the Pain arc, since it addresses the plot point of Naruto protecting the village that shunned him and surpassing his master. This show gets a very low 4/10, and it would definitely be a 1 or 2 if the Pain arc wasn't a part of it.",
    "\n                Naruto review\r\nI really enjoy Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. One of the good anime I have seen lately. So I understand why some people give a hard time on Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. It has some parts I like some I didn\u2019t like. Note I have not read the mang so.\n\r\nSo what is Naruto about? Spoilers. A boy that has lost his parents. End hi is the villager outcast only because of a lot of people died due to his birts. He got one part of the nine tail fox. During the anime, we will see how hie becomes the villager\u2019s hero. And prove everyone\n                  \n\nwrong.   \n\r\nGood things.\r\nThe soundtrack and ost.\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. I really feel the sadness. I feel when he wins. When I don\u2019t know whet I when to listen to the ost. \n\r\nCharacters development\r\nCharacters development is so good. I admit a cay more to Naruto then when I watch Violet Evergarden. They only to anime I have a cry too. You really the feeling when someone dying how it affects the people related. Some just want to take revenge and don\u2019t cany to get revenge. \n\r\nSome just break down like when Jiraiya died Naruto was in a deep depression only his friends could help him. Everyone has maybe felt the same sometimes when you lost a family member or someone close to you. It plays a lot on the watcher\u2019s feelings.\n\r\nAnd Iruka Umino becomes like a father figure to naruto. I think some people find a father figure in people how they don\u2019t have any family contact.\n\r\nThe world.\r\nAll the different villages have something interesting to it. Someplace is ikonic like the swing at the school, ramen Ichiraku, and Naruto house. One of my favorites is ending 34 it shows the ramen Ichiraku has been there for every for everything. \n\r\nThe battels \r\nIt amazing all I have to side. When they choose when to not have music or not. I found a Youtube video they explain my point.\n\r\nBad things\r\nNaruto has a lot of good things but one of the bigs problems only problem for me is the filler episodes and filler arc. I like backstory but if the filler episodes or arc in the middle of another arc it is a problem. I watch the war arc it has some good thing but the biggest problem for me is they from nowhere a filler arc. And how will get in visited in the fight if start a filler arc or episodes. The place between two big arcs not in the middle of a big arc. \r\nA lot of anime which is not 720 episodes(Naruto and Naruto Shipp\u016bden)  have to don it match better. Like far Fairy Tail. Fairy Tail is only 328  episodes long. You place the filler arc or episodes between two big arcs, not in the middle of a big arc. But filler arc or episodes may not be that long.  \n\r\nAnd one small about the fight. For me, it feels they switch a lot between the battels. How will I get invested in the fight? But a thing it was more in Naruto not, a lot in Naruto Shipp\u016bden.      \n\r\nSo should you watch Naruto? Absolutely. The time we live in right now some people may be stuck indoors. Then you have finished one of the big 3. You don\u2019t have to watch Naruto Next Generations it like a side story. Hopp my English is understandable.",
    "\n                GOAT of tv in my opinion. The Naruto franchise was what introduced me into anime so I am very biased but I truly believe that most people that have seen this will agree with me.\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10 The pain arc, 4th war arc, and post 4th war arc are the best arcs in history in my opinion. This show made me get off my seat because I was so hyped and it has also made me cry at times. Truly a masterpiece of a story\n\r\nART: 10/10 The art style changed all of the time so its hard to rate, but for the most part it is\n                  \n\nfantastic. \n\r\nSOUND: 10/10 This soundtrack is so good, i have it in my playlists. GOATED soundtrack\n\r\nCHARACTER: Every character could be argued to be the best (minus Tenten). Every character is unique and awesome in their own way.\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 favorite of all time\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10 Greatest anime of all time, loved it, perfect.",
    "\n                Naruto shippuden...This anime is one of best examples of manga turned into anime, The story is lengthy and long but, As we see the episodes the viewer gets absorbed in it.The character design are good.The special powers known as 'Jutsu' are more then awesome.There are several arcs in this series and the MC of story, I more like teenagers of today BOLD, KIND, SMART.\n\r\nThings I like most in this series are-\n\r\n1. The Storyline\r\n2. Humour touch\r\n3.The relationships between the characters. \r\n4.The Jutsu\r\n5.The MC attitude\r\n6 . Individual and important role of each character.\n\n\n\r\nBasically it is a great story of friendship, love, and power.",
    "\n                \"Naruto: Shippuuden\" is a sequel to the immensely popular anime series \"Naruto,\" and it continues the journey of Naruto Uzumaki as he matures into a formidable ninja while facing new challenges and adversaries. This long-running series, spanning over 500 episodes, has left an indelible mark on the anime landscape. Here's a comprehensive review, weighing both the positive and negative aspects of \"Naruto: Shippuden.\"\n\r\nPositive Aspects:\n\r\nCharacter Development: One of the strongest points of \"Naruto: Shippuden\" is its deep exploration of characters. Viewers witness significant growth in Naruto as he evolves from a brash and impulsive ninja into a more nuanced and compassionate leader. Other characters, such as\n                  \n\nSasuke, Sakura, and even the supporting cast, receive substantial development, adding layers to their personalities.\n\r\nComplex Plot: The narrative of \"Shippuden\" delves into intricate plotlines, weaving together themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the consequences of war. The complexity of the story keeps viewers engaged, and the unveiling of mysteries surrounding Naruto's origin and the Akatsuki organization adds depth to the overall plot.\n\r\nEpic Battles: The series is renowned for its epic and visually stunning battles. The animation quality improves significantly from its predecessor, with dynamic fight sequences showcasing the characters' diverse abilities. Memorable showdowns like Naruto vs. Pain and Sasuke vs. Itachi are highlights of the series.\n\r\nWorld-Building: \"Naruto: Shippuden\" expands the rich and expansive world introduced in the original series. Viewers are treated to a deeper understanding of the ninja villages, their politics, and the lore behind jutsu and legendary figures. The world-building contributes to the immersive experience of the series.\n\r\nEmotional Resonance: The anime masterfully tackles emotional themes, bringing viewers to tears on numerous occasions. Moments of friendship, sacrifice, and self-discovery are portrayed with genuine emotion, enhancing the connection between the characters and the audience.\n\r\nNegative Aspects:\n\r\nPacing Issues: \"Naruto: Shippuden\" is notorious for its pacing problems, especially in the later arcs. Prolonged flashbacks, repetitive internal monologues, and filler episodes can make the narrative feel sluggish. This hampers the overall flow of the story and may test the patience of viewers.\n\r\nFiller Episodes: Like its predecessor, \"Shippuden\" suffers from a significant number of filler episodes. While some fillers offer interesting side stories, others feel forced and disrupt the main plot's momentum. Viewers seeking a more streamlined experience may find these episodes frustrating.\n\r\nPower Creep: As the series progresses, the power levels of characters escalate to astronomical levels. While this is common in many shonen anime, \"Shippuden\" occasionally stretches the boundaries of believability, making it challenging to gauge the true impact of certain battles.\n\r\nUnderutilized Characters: Despite having a vast ensemble cast, some characters receive inadequate screen time or character development. This is particularly noticeable with certain members of Naruto's generation, leaving fans yearning for more exploration of their abilities and stories.\n\r\nAnticlimactic Resolution: The final resolution of the series, particularly the way certain conflicts are resolved, may leave some fans feeling unsatisfied. The conclusion of long-standing plotlines might feel rushed, and certain character arcs may not receive the closure they deserve.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Naruto: Shippuden\" is a compelling anime with a rich tapestry of characters, intricate storytelling, and memorable moments. While it has its share of flaws, including pacing issues and filler episodes, the overall impact of the series on the anime community cannot be denied. For those willing to invest the time and overlook some shortcomings, \"Naruto: Shippuden\" offers a rewarding and emotionally resonant journey through the ninja world.",
    "\n                If you're looking for an anime that teaches the value of never giving up on a friend, this is a must-see! \n\r\nThere's a reason the Naruto series is so popular: ninjas. \u2714\ufe0f Superpowers? \u2714\ufe0f Action-packed adventures? \u2714\ufe0f\u2714\ufe0f \r\nShippuden may appear to be just another shonen, but it is far more complex than that. You can learn a lot of life lessons from it. For example, it emphasizes hard work and coping with loss, among other important themes. Sure, the flashy action and cool ninjutsu are visually appealing, but what really drew me in was the story behind the characters' motivations. The lines between good and\n                  \n\nevil are blurred; it's clear why each side believes what they do and do what they do. It's refreshing! A nice change from the typical 2D shonen, where one side is purely evil and the other is completely good.\n\r\nHowever....it is not without flaws. The filler episodes can be dull, but they do not detract from the main plot and can be skipped without missing anything important....unlike Boruto. There is also room for improvement, particularly in character development. Out of the vast number of ninjas, some of the main characters' backstories appear rushed or even nonexistent! But.. I'm not going to spoil anything for you! Even if shonen isn't your thing, this is an anime you should not miss! \n\r\nBelieve me, you're in for a real treat!",
    "\n                ok so I've seen like 69+ series and I will have to say that this is most pathetic series. I watched up to shippuden 40. I am telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway.\n\r\nthe plot is lacking and its excuse of a slice of life/action-drama type of show. I am posting this for people who haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all.\n\r\nThe characters are shite. The mc just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who\n                  \n\nall the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. It is waste of your days and you should watch something else instead. It will take over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive like watching one piece. PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden is the successor of Naruto. With it comes the return of the Akatsuki, new power scaling levels, new characters, and an extended history of the shinobi world. It boasts a significantly higher number of episodes than its predecessor. \r\nA part of me wants to give this anime a 10, but the other half wants me to give it a 6.5. To vaguely describe Naruto Shippuden's quality: \"When the show is good, it's VERY good. When the show has its shitty moments, they really smell.\"\r\nSome of the best shonen arcs come from Part 2 of Naruto. \n\r\nThings Naruto Part II improves over Naruto Part\n                  \n\nI\r\n-The art style is now smoother and more simple. This can be taken as a neutral or negative since it's not as stylized as before\r\n-The soundtrack is PLENTIFUL times better than Part I's. Most tracks are beautifully composed and orchestrated.\r\n-The villains are better in Part II. The Akatsuki is officially introduced to its full potential here. \r\n-More emotional than its predecessor. Naruto was already a pretty emotional show and Shippuden intensifies it.\r\n-The history is very rich. The entire ninja world is developed and makes the setting feel more alive\r\n-Had some of the best arcs in shonen anime: Itachi Pursuit/Battle Between Brothers, Hidden Rain Infiltration, and The Pain Invasion\r\n-The fights and choreography are some of the best in shonen anime\n\r\nThe BAD of Naruto Part II\r\n-Many many MANY plot-holes. They aren't noticeable as you watch the show, but when you stop and reflect, they become very apparent. \r\n-Characters that got the spotlight are now disregarded heavily in Part II. It focused a lot on the main cast, and not the supporting cast.\r\n-The power scaling got out of hand quick after the 5 Kage Summit arc. Naruto and Sasuke became Gods, which was very unnecessary.\r\n-The longest arc in the show wasn't correctly done and was too dragged out. The main source of plot-holes in the show\r\n-The final villain was awfully introduced. \n\r\nAs we see, Naruto Shippuden improved on Naruto a lot, but at the same time, did worse in so many aspects that Naruto did right. I'd recommend watching Shippuden if you've already seen Naruto. Personally, I adore the show even when it has obvious flaws. The good overshadows the sloppy writing near the end, and I love it for what it is.",
    "\n                Story: The story takes place a few years where Naruto has become much stronger, More mature, and Is much happier than within the last series, but That only shows how much Naruto and The rest of the character cast has grown. Naruto is only a few steps closer to achieving his dreams and Becoming strongest in his village.\n\r\nArt: The art is much better compared to Naruto while Shippuden makes things smoother and cleaner looking. Which is why I had to give it a higher rating, it's much better in animation.\n\r\nSound: The sound is just like that of Naruto. It has a great amount of intros/outros\n                  \n\nand Again! It's too hard to choose which intro or outro I favor the most.  \n\r\nCharacter Development: Character development is obviously here as we can see Naruto has grown and Has become a different person entirely compared to his younger self back in Naruto. The same can be said with everyone else. \n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I did enjoy this more than Naruto itself. The fights we're more hyped and energetic, The animation was much better, and We all got to see Naruto mature with his friends and Become someone entirely different. Which is why I gave Shippuden a higher rating as well. \n\r\nOverall: Shippuden is PERFECT! As it surpasses expectations and Shows us why Shippuden has only made The Naruto series better with overall time and Consideration creating the next series of Naruto. Sadly I can't the same about Boruto, as that is garbage, but We will talk about that when we get there. \n\r\nI rate Naruto:Shippuden a 10 OUT OF 10 \n\r\nNaruto: Shippuden is a PERFECT anime!\n\r\nPros:\r\nActual Story Progression \r\nCharacter Growth/Development\r\nSurpassed My Expectations \n\r\nCons:\r\nThere was some filler, but Meh.",
    "\n                An anime that to me screams Character Development! <3\n\r\nSo first you watch Naruto when they were kids, Sasuke decides to leave the village forever and Naruto tries to bring him back. The two face off in a climactic showdown, but Sasuke comes out as the victor.\n\r\nNow you watch Naruto Shippuden, and they aren't kids anymore, they're more grown up. You follow both Naruto and Sasuke's story as they aim to reach their own personal goals and see their fates collide once more.\n\r\nAlso I think in the first episode already we jump right into the action. The Akatsuki terrorist group that you may remember from the\n                  \n\nfirst series Naruto is back and two new Akatsuki members are introduced. The Akatsuki is already a big deal and then you meet two more and you're like \"Oh my god, what will their unique jutsu be, just how strong are they\".\n\r\nThe moment those two Akatsuki members showed up I got hyped. I realized they aren't kids anymore, the ninja we follow. They're grown up, it's more serious now, jutsu more powerful, ...HYPE!!\n\r\nThe anime is pretty long which makes for a good story, many adventures, many fights, new discoveries of one's past etc.\n\r\nIn Naruto, you know Sasuke is after vengeance for his family, looking for his brother. It takes a good while in Naruto Shippuden when it finally happens...the confrontation...the rematch...OOOOOO!!!! (sorry) They're just so good at building up for that moment. Also when they finally showed us the birth of Naruto...the attack on the village, what happened?! MY GOD <3\n\r\nAlso, this anime isn't scared to let go of 'good characters', allies who we followed for some time. We saw their journey throughout the series, and when the end is knocking and they start showing those flashbacks, final revelations....the FEELS!!!! <3 I'd be a liar if I didn't shed a tear here and there.\n\r\nOne thing that bothers me a little though is fillers...filler episodes, they're out there, and there are quite a few. Can be interesting if you want to see 'extra story' about characters, but apart from that it's a bit annoying to me. Buuuuuut if you are planning to watch it now and haven't seen it yet ever, you can skip all those fillers and just happily continue with the story episodes :)\n\r\nAnyway that'll be all....In short: Great character development, lots of cool fights, the feels! Great anime",
    "\n                First review so don't expect it to be super.\r\nNaruto: Shippuden is set two and a half years after Naruto leaves the Leaf Village to train with Jiraiya and the overall story starts off from that after the main villain the Akatsuki were beginning to move out. This show gets a lot of hate mainly because of the ridiculous amount of fillers which is nearly half the show, some are enjoyable and give more depth to a character, others are completely pointless and totally random. But once you get past that the show is nothing short of excellent, amazing fights, beautiful soundtrack and a pretty great\n                  \n\nstory until the final act of the show which gets a little too out of hand. The art is nothing to write home about but it doesn't disappoint except for one episode, when you get there you'll know it. \r\nThis shows main theme is bonds and how Naruto must overall protect his bonds and strengthen them to gain allies and become stronger. The characters are well fleshed out and all given clear motives for each one and excellent backstories are put into place here. The lore is also only enriched here and everything is more developed as all mysteries were explained and answered well and the best is yet to come.\r\nOverall this anime is worth a watch as long as you've completed the first part and can either handle filler or just decide to skip it all together. That's not to say at the end it stumbles, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime as it was my gateway into all the anime I watch now and I still come back for some nostalgia.",
    "\n                I Love how unlike Bleach, you can see an end to this and finally put it in your complete files. I can't stand Sasuke but more than him (and even Danzo), I. Can't. Stand. Sakura. Her motivations and emotions are so wishy-washy and unfathomable and retarded beyond possibility. What pisses me off though is that I feel Naruto and Sasuke are going to fight for the death (honestly, it's gotten too out of control for either of them to survive) and I'm okay with that (it's a reasonable ending and somewhat satisfying; Naruto and Sasuke are equals that will cancel eachother out and just the\n                  \n\nmemory of their greatness will be enough to inspire future generations) except that can only mean that Sakura will survive to tell their story (that's how these things usually go). And before you flag me for spoilers, just remember this pure opinion and i don't even read the manga. Other than one or two irritating characters (had to get it off my chest) The story is great; filler is somewhat annoying but the story and the characters (minus the ones mentioned above) makes up for it and the music is awesome. Great anime.",
    "\n                I dont know what to say about this anime adaptation, I have just too many mixed feelings about this, on one hand I believe naruto's plot is esentially the most amazing plot ever but I MUST give the story a 7 just becuse of the filler episodes which werent all that awful, I did like like.. 2? out of what? 100? they are awful, for real the worst torture ever was to wait every week for a new chapter just to get a filler episode.. I skipped 99% of them and I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to see them, they are a waste of time,\n                  \n\nso you can just go to wikipedia, locate those filler episodes and skip them. Filler episodes are just like naruto's movies; too under quality compared to the actual plot episodes.\n\r\nFor the art, this DESERVES a 3. Why on earth would anyone let this mediocre studio get the anime adapation of such a masterpiece? come on, I did laugh at the art on most chapters but that shouldn't be the point.. compared to the manga and from a real fan who has followed naruto for 10 years literally the art makes you wanna cry. I personally can't stand bad art animes but I did stand naruto's only because of its overall masterpiece storyline (that's a good point somehow I guess)\n\r\nSound is amazing, it has the best sountrack in matter of openings and endings to me at least, I do love them all and they all make me feel really emotional, the ost is also nice, it gets you into the ninja atmposphere, it's really accurate.\n\r\nNaruto has one of the most wonderful characters ever made. Its length also gives space for these characters to be amazingly good developed, in my opinion naruto's characters are the best part from the whole anime adaptation/manga. Chapters dedicated to them actually make you understand even the bad ones and you may be able to love most of them, with all their individual storylines which are outstanding. Best character development out of all anime industry in my opinion.\n\r\nIt has an awful end which I'm not gonna spoil and that's the only reason I give it an overall 8 instead of a 10 (even when considering art and filler episodes I should probably be harsher) just because its good stuff is just too good. 100% recommend watching, just skip filler episodes and don't expect a thing out of the art.",
    "\n                I can easily say that Naruto Shippuuden is hands down the BEST anime I have seen.\r\nIt has everything from action, to comedy, romance, friendship and more. The message that Naruto himself portrays is a very important one that many people could take note of in their every day real lives.\r\nThe main story line is gripping, with lots of twists that tug on your heart strings.\r\nI see many others complaining about fillers and such, but I think the fillers are great to get to know the back story of different characters and not just the main ones.\r\nAll in all, a fantastic show that any anime lover\n                  \n\nshould at least watch once!",
    "\n                It was good to start since they had some decent fillers and plus they added alot of stuff like a bigger naruto & sakura vs kakashi battle, and more scenes like who the 6 paths of nagato's team was at first but it went down hill when naruto went to the 6th tail form when fighting pain. The animation went down big time. Plus crappy fillers appear like shino crying cause his bugs died and the bird filler arc. It's a shame cause there is no reason to do these stupid fillers. why not do a filler about declining about joining the Akatsuki and then\n                  \n\ntobi threatens his villiage or something if he doesn't attack the villiage while they are preparing for war or what about instead of that dumb sea arc they have naruto trying to learn how to master the nine tails on his own and then fails then he figures out killer bee is the 8 tails so he can learn how to control his tailed beast at the island. I just don't like the anime really anymore because it doesn't seem as epic as the manga.",
    "\n                The penultimate story of growth in a ninja. A story that took 15 years to tell on screen, 10 of which were in this series. A tale that spans exactly 500 episodes and leads to a feeling of satisfaction and completion. This is the legend of Naruto Uzumaki.\n\r\nStory: 9/10\n\r\nThe story takes place following the events of \"Naruto: The Series\". Sasuke is gone. Naruto has gone to train with Master Jiraiya. Everyone else in Naruto's ninja class has some sort of training to do of their own. We come back from the 2 year time jump to Naruto's return to the Leaf Village. Time to start\n                  \n\nthe endless train of action, suspense, and detailed storytelling. Naruto must prevent the heinous Akatsuki group from stealing the power of the tailed beasts to start a massive war that spans across the world, all the while trying to find his lost friend and return him home. While some filler arcs take place here and there and some episodes are akin to Dragon Ball in that there's a whole lot of standing around and talking, the action and set-pieces are a joy to behold and you can't wait to see what happens next.\n\r\nArt: 8/10\n\r\nAs soon as the first episodes airs, you can see a difference in quality and design in the animation department compared to the first series. Vivid colors and detailed expressions are abound in every scene. Fight sequences are expertly choreographed and have your eyes jumping around the screen. On rare instances, the animation turns to a swift, almost comedic style, especially during rapid fight sequences (Naruto vs Pain). However, these changes in quality are almost endearing and help express the action even better in my opinion.\n\r\nSound: 8/10\n\r\nThe music and voice acting that goes into this show are stellar. Sure, we get a lot of Naruto screaming and shouting, but the emotional and happy points in the story are all worth it in the end. Seeing character's emotions on full display through voice acting is genuinely an art on its own. The music tracks that play throughout the story help bolster scenes and the emotions that viewers should be feeling.\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\n\r\nThis is the driving force of a story. Character development and how they alter and mature through the course of a series is paramount to its enjoyment. Here, we see characters change their views on the world and its outlook just on the basis of a few words. The power of words can be very strong, especially when they're wielded by someone who never gives up. Nearly every character that we got to know in the first series has a moment to shine at some point, granted it's 500 episodes in its entirety.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\r\nOverall, I had a blast watching this series. I never read the manga, so I never knew what to expect during each episode. The occasional filler arc was a drag to have to wait through, but sometimes you get character development that you see further down the line due to what happened during filler arcs. Once the show came around the final corner and reached its end, I was both sad to see this show reach its end, but also happy with its conclusion. \r\nThen we got Boruto, which is a creature all on its own. You can read my review of that show to see what I mean.",
    "\n                Best freaking show of all time hands down, no cap. This show changed my life in every way not even joking it has a perfect story full of development and amazing characters. I would highly highly highly recommend this show for many reasons. It taught me more about love, life and faith than anything else. I cannot say enough good about this show. Watch it and stick with it until the end the reward is insane even though it is long it is so worth it. Words don\u2019t do it justice I love it so much. This show is filled with memorable moments and characters\n                  \n\nthat will give you chills and make you a better person at the end. The soundtrack is unbelievably good and will, stick with you forever. This show cuts deep and makes you cry laugh and everything in between. This may seem like a fluffy all good review but that\u2019s because it is a perfect show I am not overdoing my love for this show.",
    "\n                Despite the never-ending fillers and flashbacks, Naruto Shippuden has a very decent storyline... Perhaps the story gets well when told in many episodes... Honestly, I love watching the fillers too except the mechanaruto episodes... Well I don't like mecha thingy... \n\r\nAbout Naruto, I love him since the Naruto series... but in Shippuden, I didn't like him when he couldn't control his anger which consequently releases the nine-tailed fox power and unintentionally hurts his friends... \n\r\nMy favourite part of the anime is the war... Everyone is united to fight the same enemy... but more importantly, there are so many surprises... Also, there are portrayals of qualities\n                  \n\nsuch as high fighting spirit and strong comraderie... I really love them...\n\r\nIf I want to compare Naruto Shippuden and the Naruto series, Naruto Shippuden has more serious plot... Mostly because of the Akatsuki... Naruto Shippuden has more tragic scenes too... and of course the fighting scenes are all the higher level ones since all of the characters had developed their attitude, skills and power... Also, Naruto Shippuden is full of emotions... I cried so many times watching this series...\n\r\nThe OP and ED mostly are good... the background songs are very very good... they match the scenes... In fact, whenever I listen to certain songs, I would remember certain scenes...and I usually end up watching again...\n\r\nFor me, Naruto Shippuden is truly a masterpiece... Well, about the fillers, I do not mind at all since they somehow make me feel attached to the characters and to the canon... In fact, some fillers add more understanding of the canon... \n\r\nTo those who want to try watching Naruto Shippuden, you must first watch the Naruto series... at least until Sasuke leave Konoha so that you could understand the bond between Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi... \ud83d\ude0a",
    "\n                This review is spoiler free.\n\r\nWell then I have been waiting to be able to write a review about an anime that has been around for almost two decades and oh boy what a anime it was. I didn't just teach us that not everything goes as planned it also teached us that everything must come to an end. And unfortunally it did. It did end, but even so this sure was a anime. Anyway let's just start!\n\r\nStory 9/10: The story, the story is just your standard Underdog Action/Adventure story, but done damn right. You have probably heard of it, but we follow a boy named\n                  \n\nNaruto, a boy that wants to be the hokage, but because he has a monster named the Ninetails sealed inside him everybody in the Hidden Leaf Village (The village Naruto lives in) stays away from him because they know what the Ninetails is capable of doing. But even so Naruto doesn't stop and let his rage take over no! Instead he struggles his way to everything hoping to find a ray of light at the end of the hellish road he has to walk. Overall the story was again just your standard underdog story, but because the series gone on for so long we were able to see all the events in detail and that is what I personally couldn't get enough of. Seeing all the characters grow up and new characters getting just as much growth to them.\n\r\nArt/Animation 8/10: The art, the art was something I never really liked nor hated. It was well standard, just your typical anime artstyle, but the reason I gave this an 8 is because of the animation. The animation was well overall barely passable, but what made it so it got an 8 then? Well it is actually quite simple It is because of the animation in some of its fights. Yeah the reason why most of the show has \"bad\" animation is for the sole reason to make a important fight stand out animation wise. And these amazingly animated fights are the reason that I got into Naruto, there is just something so satisfying seeing a fight with incredible animated choreography and a story that they are telling during the fights. It is just perfect, even though it only lasts for a couple of minutes it still drives you to watch more of it even if it is just to see another of those great animated fights.\n\r\nSound 8/10: The music of both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden aren't anything outlandish, no the opposite. It is just your upbeat songs but this time around it has a shinobilike vibe to it. And it fits perfectly. But there is none of them that really stands out to me like You Say You Run from Boku No Hero Academia for example. So overall Naruto just has some solid osts which I can enjoy even though I will forget them after the next episode anyway.\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: So the characters. Honestly Naruto has just your basic kind of characters, you have the main character that doesn't know when to give up, the rival of the main character who everybody likes but is depressed as **** and then you have the main waifu who is mostly there for \"emotional\" moments even though every time she is in an opening she cries. Anyway, even though Naruto has some of the most basic character tropes they are still different and that is because the show went on for so long the characters were able to develop their their feelings. And because of that you still manage to get attached to them.\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I'll keep this one rather short because there is not much to say. The enjoyment of this show was perfect. The anime managed to find a balance between serious fights and comedic episodes so that it never felt out of place. And because of that I could always enjoy the serious episodes but also the episodes where there are just solid jokes after jokes.\n\r\nOverall 8/10: Overall the show was really good and truly it was a once in a lifetime anime expierence. I don't know yet if I will watch boruto but what I do know is that this anime now has a special place in my heart even though it is not in my personal top 10 favorite anime. \n\r\nWell then hopefully you liked this review. This one was rather short but I am satisfied with it. Well then see ya'll!",
    "\n                Naruto Shipuden Review \r\n------------------------ \r\nSo this is a second part to my original review I made last night on Naruto. I am going to have another prr on Boruto which is my favorite. Before I watched the original Naruto series I watched an episode of Shipudden first because I did not know there was a major plot. I did not even know who like all these characters is. I mean like Sai pr whoever that was, he was hella tripping because he showed up in the second series and was never in the first series like this dood cant be pulling up this its crazy.\n                  \n\nAnyways the way how to story contiened was lit. It sucks how everyone became chunin and Naruto was training with pervy sage. like that neji bruh showing off he was jonin was pissing me off. Naruto is more op that all these fools combined and everyone keeps conplaining hes still a genin. Bruh this is when Naruto is suppose to become a hero like wtf. Anyways when Naruto shows his new powers and stuff and Sakura was trying to hit that i was like bout to go off with that ship and forget hinata but she still aint over sasuke but that k cuz sasuke actually gets cold after this 2 years. This bruh becomes op af cuz his training and yuh he def surpassed Naruto first. Tbh I feel like Naruto only grew as a person and not with his power like he did not even control the nine tail fox yet or whatever. was i also the only one to notice that every main character from team 7 had a legendary sanin. Its crazy but true. So after the second series I think i finally decided my lists of favorite people and it was really hard. So my favorite person would have to be Sasuke just the second series he becomes cooler or whatever and he just is coll but personality wise I do not know about that and we really dont have much to relate but I guess this person is just someone i like as a person. Second favorite person is alot like me and it was really hard between sasuke because rock lee is the oppisite of sasuke but he just is really cool and unique and never gives up. To be honest i liked him more in the first series because the second series he barely showed up in filler episodes. I did like alot of filler episodes but some It feels just forced. On of my favorite filler episodes is in the first season near the end with the team was Naruto, Choji, and Sakura thats a dream team tbh. Also another dream team would be Sasuke, Ino, and Sakura, Another good team would be Rock Lee, Ten Ten, and Neji. Oh wait that is a team. So anyway back to my third favorite character it is still tied up with the two characters Sasuke, and Rock Lee but it has to be Naruto. I dont know but if you were to mix Naruto, Sasuke, and Rock Lee it would most likely make me hust personality wise. Anyway it would probably seem to be Boruto because boruto works hard, is arrogant and is dumb sometimes which is my ideal favorite character. Anyways since Boruto is not in the second series I cannot put him at first. So at fourth Im gonna have to put Choji, so choji is not me but its like a friend id like to have because he eats all the time and is very funny. Tbh it was really cool to see him fight in intense battles espcially the one back in the first series againts that other fat guy and him using pills. It was weird because those food pills made him grow fatter and bigger and it kind of reminded me of other pulls that exist in real life. If you know what I mean. So another character I liked after choji would have to be a girl this time which is Sakura. So Sakura kind of a Dva but when she is in almost every episode 700 episodes 700 x 30 is like 21000 monutes with is like days and days maybe like even a week straight of sakura its like she is kinda of popping sometimes but tbh if Ino was a mainchaarcter and not supporting I dig that to. So fifth im going to have to go with Kiba. Look Kiba I liked from the beginning Early and I almost considered him my favorite character until he started talking that smack to Naruto that he was not Chunin. This brother is legit way more op than yo furry looking ass and you legit be talking that sneak dissing to Naruto like bruh shame on you brother u aint deserve to be shinobi like this ninja really be talking that mad smack. Okay so my 6th favorte character has to be Shikinaru but tbh I guess he got those made thoughts but he dont try or say everything a drag but this ninja a drag to but i felt for him after Asuna which got me actually in tears no cap no joke I dont play in this snitch. So the story art, enjoyment goes into the first Naruto series which I will put below.\r\nEven though everything was good about the series the story was the best part. Out of all the anime I have ever watched I was never so engaged with a series like this one. What made the plot so good was because of how long it is and to be honest even if the show was 12 episodes like most of the shows I have watched in the past it could have been great still but not as good if the story was just in 12 episodes. In the beginning the story was great but compared to the future plot it was average. It was cool seeing how the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke started and the first couple episodes with Naruto playing around with Sasuke and Sakura was like a fun slice of life. It is so cool that all the characters from episode 1 still exist 700 episodes later in the boruto series. It is just really cool to see this. The first C mission they did was cool because you see Naruto being annyoing but super cool as well. The chunin exams to be honest were kind of the best thing I have ever watched. This anime season of Naruto was like th best even though it was realesed during 2003. Its crazy because this was made when I was born I legit was 0 years old well this was being animated even though it is weird because the manga started in 1999 this is crayz because it existed as long as spongebob. I use to think everything made before 2010 is trash but alot of old school things are cool. The chunin exam was the most smartest thing I have ever seen in the series like legit it rose my IQ. It was so funny when Naruto did not know like anything and he was just writing down nothing. Hinata and stuff was offering him questions and at this scene I got kind of pissed cause Naruto can not see that Hinata likes him its crazy. Anyway the exams in the beginning I could tell it took alot of thought. Anyway the second exam kind of reminding me of a battle royale because they are in the forest and teams are being elimanated. I was watching Naruto and this season around the time PUBG and fortnite was becoming popular. Its crazy because I thought minecraft hungergames in like 2011 than I learned about the Battle Royale Movie from like 2000's. Than this which was crazy. At the third exams when all those kids were fighting from the main characters. It really shows the personalities of the characters. Kiba vs Naruto was my third favorite fight because it was like dog vs fox because they both have animals inside of them. The hyuga clan fight was also lit as well even though Hinata loss but they got some bonding experience which I really enjoyed. The best fight was between Rock Lee and Gaara. Tbh I never really likes Gaara he reminds me of a messed up kid who has no friends. Legit I do not feel like I have empathy for this guy even over all his flashbacks. I feel like with the right personality you can make urself likeable even if you have an animals with tails. So Rock Lee when he took off those weights it legit got me fired up. Sorry about that fairytail reference. Look the Neji fight where he took revenge for Hinata when Naruto got those good speech. Legit everybody doubted Naruto. He showed his ninja way in that fight you know but I aint spoiling anything but that fight is the reason is why Naruto is Naruto. Look I had a handful of fights and though fights are not always like this. Look fights are one sided in real life but it is so cool to see fights where you see alot of comebacks. So the fight with Shikimaru look I cant say his name but that was pretty analytical and I kind of got pissed on what rank he became because of what he done because I feel like it should be someone more deserving with power. So Sasuke is really cool and was not my favorite in the beginning because I was not digging his blue shirt but later he becomes cool. In the beginning I feel like he did not know what he was doing but his Chidori was popping espically when he popped Gaaras little pimple looking barrier. Like what was he trying to finna do it was crazy. So anyway after that the fights between that puppet guy and Shino was decent not something to remember though. Anyways the training with Jiriya whats im talking bout was the funniest thing ever and how he was training for summoning or whatever. Anyways him using that in the fight with Gaara and saying how they had the same childhood or whatever was lit. To be honest I do not believe they the same. They may of had the same childhood but what about personalize wise. Naruto is cool and funny but Gaara is not. He gained his powers from birth and Naruto work hard for this also Rock Lee is lit. Bruh him training for 10 hours straight. 24/7 GRIND that is the Rock Lee way and his ninja way and he did not deserve what he got. Look Gaara thinks his life is so hard being op and whatever but no no no. Anyway lets talk about someone who does not work at all but is also lit and this is Choji. Choji has the nonstop grind on the food though. Like I love how he eats so much potato chips and ramen. Look I eat a lot of ramen and eat noodles. Kiba is lit but also I have a grudge against him because the way he talks to his dog is hella akward. I feel like this dood is a furry tbh but who cares anyway he still is lit. Neji is an okay character and reminds me of me when I was like 5 for reasons I will not tell you at all. So after the Gaara vs Naruto their was alot of filler episodes until when the gang which is Neji, Shikimarou, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto goes and tries to retrieve Sasuke from becoming evil. It was so cool seing each one of them going after a bad guy with 2x the amount of power but since they ninjas they still found away like ghost busters. So after all of these fights it made me realize their is alot more meaning to life even though I wasted alot watching Naruto. To be honest during this time I could of been spending time on so many other things but again im wasting my life and I do not even know why its crazy. I think thats it for the story and I would give it a 10 out of 10 ok.\n\r\nThe art was from 2007 so I guess it was okay for 2007. It got a 10 after 2010 though.\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Naruto and openings pumped me up espically opening 2,5, and I think 8.\n\r\nEnjoyment was a 10 because of the ships and how they sailed.\n\r\nOverall a 10.",
    "\n                It took me a whole year to finish the Naruto: Shippuuden series. One of the reasons is my inconsistency to anime, the other however is the times I've simply got bored from the amount of unnecessary episodes in a row there were. The amount of fillers there are is the LARGEST flaw this series has to offer. Some viewers decide to skip filler episodes which is a viable solution, seeing that there are little fillers with contribution to the actual story. Another flaw the show has is the soundtrack, it becomes tedious and almost aggravating hearing the same soundtrack a hundred times over a conversation\n                  \n\nor in a fight scene, I may be overreacting but it's something that upset me. The last flaw i have to talk about is Naruto's determination to return Sasuke. (I hope this common knowledge among everyone and I'm not spoiling anything) I found it very hard to accept that a human could be so determined to go after someone like Naruto did with Sasuke, specifically because how little time they spent together and they hadn't gotten along all that well. The whole \"Because you're my friend\" reasoning wore out real soon and just looked like it was a makeshift pillar to hold up the story. I'm sorry if others feel differently than I do about this aspect in the story but it's how I viewed it.\n\r\nThe rest of the story for me, was amazing. I absolutely loved the branching story lines throughout each of the characters, taking place in several eras. The switching of antagonists is something I adored, especially whenever they seemingly turned a new leaf (hehe.) The most crucial fight scenes in the story held lots of importance and gave users many different emotions making them near perfectly put together. Watching Naruto change over time in the story was the most beautiful aspect to me which puts Naruto: Shippuuden in a place close to my heart.",
    "\n                With how decent Naruto part 1 was, many people moved on to Naruto Shippuden, part 2 of the popular anime series. While in the manga it is still called Naruto, Part 2 enters a 3 year time skip after the events of Naruto part 1. And here's where it all goes wrong. Not at the start of of course. Actually everything seems to be going the Naruto way (Not that that's perfect or anything, just serviceable). When you have a series that goes on this long, one would expect you to write yourself into many corners, and that's exactly what happens here. Naruto Shippuden taints\n                  \n\nthe foundation of what made Naruto so great. The animation is worse, the story loses focus, action shifts itself into a penis measuring contest where every fight tries to outdo the last with little to no fines or choreography, characters stay one dimensional throughout the entire run time, and of course we shift from a story about ninjas into a story about divine power and who gets to own it. Most people may see this as \"upping the ante\", but to me, it's just a lazy and poorly written way to boost manga sales and anime views without actually delivering some worthwhile content that can leave a deep impact emotionally, like a story should. Naruto Shippuden also manages to somehow rewrite it's own themes and messages given prior and ruin some of it's lead cast of characters, including Naruto Uzumaki himself. The series succeeds to pull things from out of nowhere, and treat them as standard fare. How was Guy able to even leave a scratch on Six Paths Madara? (I know it was the eight gate, but Madara was basically omnipotent at that point, and taijutsu did him in a bit? Bullshit) How was it that Kaguya's will was used to create Black Zetsu when we saw Madara create it himself? How was Madara able to revive himself with izanagi if he was already dead? How come Obito was able to survive the Ten Tails extraction? Better yet, why the fuck does Kaguya even exist?! And why is Naruto the Child of Prophecy when his characters theme was carving your own path? And by god that horribly rushed ending... I can go on about how Naruto Shippuden really dropped the ball, but it would take too long. In short, Shippuden seems ambitious, but it falls flat in the end with little to no pay off.",
    "\n                 Great Animation, Intricate and emotional story-line, deeply recurring morals, person to self conflict, ... Overall Naruto is an amazing anime, to have the dedication to watch/read all of it his hard to grasp at first, but after a while you become deeply attached to it, borderline obsessed. Naruto is an amazing character, and I learned to have determination from im. He is inspirational in his struggle to overcome his flaws, to keep moving forward even in the toughest of times. The raw emotion Naruto exhibits at times is so personal that even the watcher can feel his pain. In a sense, they make the\n                  \n\nreader become frustrated at naruto for his flaws and hate his determination to make the reader understand first-hand how much naruto suffers from hate. They essentially make the reader empathize with those that put naruto down, to later realize the affect it has on him. This is truly a master piece, after so many years Naruto has still kept my attention, something extremely difficult to manage with an anime as long as this one.",
    "\n                Firstly, I have read the entirety of the Naruto manga and am up to date with the Shippuuden anime series, but I will try and make this review as SPOILER FREE as possible, as long as you have seen the original Naruto series.\n\r\nI will not be mentioning \"filler\" content in this review, everything will be related to the canon manga.\n\r\nSo Naruto: Shippuuden starts off 2 years after the events of Naruto. They're all a little bit older now, and a hell of a lot stronger now. The spoiler free story for those who have finished the original series, is pretty much Naruto training hard with\n                  \n\nhis two goals, one of becoming the Hokage, and the other is bringing Sasuke back to the village.\n\r\nStory 10/10:\r\nFor someone who has read the entirety of the manga and seen everything so far of the anime, I must say it is an amazing story the entire way through Shippuuden with no plot holes and everything fitting in perfectly. This show is full of twists and turns, some that you might expect and other's that will just blow you out of nowhere. Trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible, the story follows Naruto as he gets stronger and stronger, unlocking new Jutsu's and powers throughout as he tries to achieve his one true goal of becoming Hokage. However you are solely mistaken if you think the story of Shippuuden is nothing but the character Naruto, as Naruto is only one of the three main characters and the story follows the other two just as much and also goes very in depth with a lot of the support characters too. They all play their own major role in the different events that happen in the story. Would be really hard to say much more about the story without spoiling anything, so ill end it there.\n\r\nArt 10/10:\r\nAs an art and animation student at a university, this art is definitely my most favourite type of art that any anime can ever have. Its very defined, very simplistic and also looks very realistic and amazing. With just a few lines and curves making up a characters face, every one of them is different yet they are all still so simple which makes it the best art to have. I've always said to myself if I were to create my own art style, I would heavily reference the art style of Naruto. Every different emotion is defined perfectly on every character without having to go over the top and greatly exaggerating the persons face, like some other anime's do.\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\r\nThe character's is probably the main reason I really love watching these long running shounen anime's, and more specific, Naruto Shippuuden. I have seen the entirety of whats out of One Piece, Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter and Fairy Tail and Naruto: Shippuuden has the best or second best characters of all of them. Every character has a different personality and a different skill set and almost every character in the series at one point in the show has a back story or a \"flashback\" to tell you more about them, which is exactly what you want when you find a character who you favourite in a show and want to know more about them. Trying to create my favourite character list without filling half of it with Naruto characters was a serious challenge.\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\r\nI enjoyed this series so much, that It took me just over two months to watch the very first episode of the original Naruto series, to episode 468 of the Naruto Shippuuden series, and also to read the rest of the manga until the end, and... to watch Naruto: The Last, Boruto: Naruto The Movie and get up to date with the Boruto manga, but they're all topics of a different day. I even enjoyed most of the filler episodes, although some of them got boring, I wanted to watch them anyway because I simply just wanted to watch more of Naruto because of how much I love this show.\n\r\nI'm gonna end this review with saying that Naruto: Shippuuden is 2nd on my favourite list out of over 150 anime's and that it is a must watch for those who have seen the original Naruto series. If you're here without watching the original series, then what are you doing! Hurry up and watch the original series!",
    "\n                Peace to all.\n\r\nI don't want to be considered as the hater here about Naruto Shippuden. Don't get me wrong. I have watched the complete manga and also \"Naruto Anime\" complete and I have found them both very pleasant; great series with a excelent history and a whole new world, with the exception of the last episodes. \n\r\nLet me make it very clear. This review is about Naruto Shippuden, the anime, not the manga of Naruto or the anime Naruto, which are great.\n\r\nStory 7 of 10:\r\nFirst of all, I would like to say that NS is pretty much overrated. The main spine of the story is\n                  \n\nvery good, but is (most of the times) very predictible. Basing on the motivation and purpose of the main chatacter we could say that it's monotonous and ever sometimes annoying. The anime is full of pointless filler plots that the team of production use to gain some time, making the story a total mess. \n\r\nArt 7 of 10: \r\nNot much to say about it. In this part I have to explain that I was very disappointed with the animation and art of this anime. Having watched Naruto, you'll know that I mean. Some fights were just poorly made and sometimes it even gives the impression of being made by some kind of fanart (without stealing credit to the great FanArts that are out there.)\n\r\nSound 8 of 10:\r\nThe sound is in fact very good. Almost all the main songs (Ending or opening) are well made and kept a good relation with the serie. The soundtrack is fun and unique, not being able to compare to any other thing.\n\r\nCharacter 8 of 10:\r\nHere you have a good variety. Everyone has it's own history. You'll surely find one that you will be identified with. The characters are marked by families and a sort of abilities so it's very easy to found a favorite and embrace it. Here, I have to make the exception of the fill stories, whose characters are just useless. Totally useless.\n\r\nFinaly in Enjoyment and Overall it's a solid 7 of 10:\r\nYou can definetly have some fun and exceiment watching this anime, especialy if you saw Naruto (If you havent dont watch this one, xD), buuuut (and it's a big \"but\") the animation and plot takes a lot of the enjoyment of the series, so badly sometimes that it's even  harmfull to your eyes. If you dont believe me, search \"Pain's fight\" in youtube. Just saying.",
    "\n                I see alot of people give this show bad or decent reviews. I honestly have no idea why people don`t like this anime. The biggest problem people seem to have with this is the amount of filler that is in it, which obviously is a problem. But almost all of the anime that are long like this have alot of filler and it`s way worse with other anime. Sometimes in this anime it`s even pretty enjoyable. It can give a nice relief to some of the intense situations that are going on. But if you wanted to skip the filler it`s really simple and obvious.\n                  \n\nThere are many sites that show which episodes are legit or not.\n\r\nCharacters:\r\nSo other than the Filler this is the greatest anime/tv show I have ever watched. Everything is so well done in this, the characters are all super likeable and perfect. Even the bad guys are awesome in this. Plus there are so many characters that its easy to get attatched to a couple of them. I guess it`s similar to One piece in that way, so if you liked One Piece you`re definitely going to like as much or probably more.\n\r\nThe animation and sound:\r\nTHe animation in this is well done, it`s definitely better than naruto was but it`s nothing groundbreaking. I didnt have any problems with the sound, I actually really loved the voice actors for english. Also has some pretty good action music and intros. Most of the songs are pretty great.\n\r\nThe story:\r\nI loved the story to this anime. it has the perfect story. There is just the right amount of action, comedy and serious moments in this. \n\r\nOverall: \r\nI highly recommend that you watch this anime, it is long so it`ll take a while but it`ll definitely be worth it. You will feel like you lived an entirely different life.",
    "\n                I was skeptical at first with Naruto Shippuden because shonen anime has a terrible reputation for being too long, drawn-out, and humorless. But now, after watching the series, I think that Naruto Shippuden deserves all the praise that it gets. \n\r\nFollowing the sequel to the original Naruto, Naruto Shippuden follows the story of our favorite hyperactive knucklehead ninja, Naruto Uzumaki. Only, this time, Naruto and his friends are teenagers. This anime can be divided into 2 main arcs, the Akatsuki arc, and The Fourth Great Ninja War arc. \n\r\nThe Akatsuki arc is the superior of the 2 arcs listed above. Back in Naruto, we were\n                  \n\nintroduced to a criminal organization with unknown motives. In Naruto Shippuden, Naruto and his friends will fight all the Akatsuki members. The Akatsuki is undoubtedly one of the best evil anime organizations ever. Each character is so unique and has their own little unique quirk. \n\r\nThe Fourth Great Ninja War is arguably the decline of the Naruto series. Retcons, power escalation, and insane amounts of fillers contribute to The Fourth Great Ninja War's flaws. But even after all that, The Fourth Great Ninja War is still in my opinion, decent. It expanded the lore of the Naruto series and tied all loose ends of the narrative. The Fourth Great Ninja War was also filled with suspense, thrill, and mystery. The fights scenes are also ones to behold, there were so many fantastic fights scenes in The Fourth Great Ninja War. Some people say that this arc will Naruto's downfall, while others loved it for the fantastic fight scenes. Really, my largest complaint about The Fourth Great Ninja War was the finale. \n\r\nPeople gripe about the amount of fillers in Naruto Shippuden, but I think that is unjustified. Now that the show is finished, you can just skip the fillers. And I highly advise you do.\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, like most shonen animes. It is one of the better drawn shonen animes, although definitely not the best. I think it is better than One Piece's art but worse than Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, and Bleach.\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Naruto Shippuden is outstanding. It has one of the best soundtrack I have ever had the privilege to listen too. Its soundtrack is up there with Fairy Tail and Death Note.\n\r\nThe amount of character development in Naruto Shippuden is amazing. My only gripe about it is that some of the amazing side characters that were hyped in part one get sidelined. Characters like Neji, Gaara, and Rock Lee had so much more potential. The main character's developments are one of the best in shonen anime.\n\r\nI immensely enjoyed Naruto Shippuden and I would recommend it to everyone.",
    "\n                The story of Naruto Shippuden continues where part 1 ended, the main plot of the series consists of Naruto trying to bring his friend Sasuke back to the village and aspiring to become the next Hokage. While the story may seem basic you truly feel attached to the characters and the story and want to know how the story will conclude, this could be due to how many episodes the show has. The show has some very high points for art and it has some pretty low points but when the show wants to it can look phenomenal. Honestly, I believe this show has one\n                  \n\nof the best soundtracks to any anime, all the songs can either make you feel insanely hyped up for a fight or even make you severely depressed (i.e. Sadness and Sorrow). I might be biased for enjoying the characters as much as I did, simply because I started watching Naruto when I was 7 years old and seeing him grow up at the same rate that I did really create a sense of relatability and overall made me more invested in his journey to become Hokage. It is clear by the end of the show that most characters are pushed to the back and Naruto and Sasuke really take center stage, but even so, every character still felt real to some degree. Personally, Naruto is one of my favorite animes despite its flaws and I would highly recommend watching the show!",
    "\n                As someone who watched the original Naruto anime growing up, I found myself enjoying Naruto shippuuden a lot.  I recently got back into anime, and decided to finish one that I never got around to from my middle school years.  As I watched the show, I slowly went from an overcritical skeptic, to a cautious optimist, to a Naruto fanboy.  Like so many characters of the show, Naruto had won me to his side, for a variety of reasons.  \n\r\nThe strongest part of the show has to be its music, in my opinion.  It had many great openings, ending, and\n                  \n\na fantastic soundtrack.  Some of my favorites would be OP 3 - blue bird, OP 16 - silhouette, and Hyouhaku just to name a few.  The OST would almost always perfectly complement what was happening on screen and add to the emotional impact in a meaningful way.  My only gripe with the  OST is that with 500 episodes, it gets tiring hearing the same thing over and over, even if the songs are excellent.  \n\r\nNaruto shippuuden's art is very interesting.  For the most part, each episode has the same aesthetic, but, every once in while, the viewer sees an incredible, bad ass, brutal fight.  Shippuuden has many great fight scenes, that shine on a technical level. \n\r\nThe story is fairly straightforward, Naruto is on a quest to save his friend Sasuke, but life throws a few curveballs at both Naruto and Sasuke.  Without giving too much away, the story is better than most, but shippuuden has a bad habit of lagging.  What I mean by that is that, it takes time for the plot to progress.  I should also mention the filler.  The amount of filler in shippuuden is very high, but seeing as the show is now over, I highly recommend to the reader, that they skip the filler.  In the beginning we could expect the filler only in between major arcs, but towards the end, the anime gets a bit heavy on filler, and it ends up obstructing the action and displacing all tension from earlier.  You are only doing yourself a favor if you skip the filler.  \n\r\nThe characters of Naruto shippuuden were a big part of why I enjoyed the anime as much as I did.  I was already attached to the cast from Naruto, but shippuuden did good job of furthering development of some of my favorites characters.  Not just Naruto, but seeing Shikamaru, Jiraiya, the nine tails, Sasuke, and Itachi grow was something I really enjoyed seeing.  Unfortunately, shippuuden also neglected some original characters as well, such as Sakura, Lee, Ten Ten, Neji, Kiba, and Asuma.  Nevertheless, I always found myself invested in someone on screen.  But, the FINAL villain, was really stupid, I did not care for that person, but the fight was enjoyable to watch at least.  \n\r\nI mentioned earlier that Shippuuden won me over, and that is very accurate.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered for my boys as they fought the good fight, I was floored by the badassery that occurred on screen, and there were times when I cursed out villains and their schemes.  I think that Naruto and Naruto shippuuden are shows worth watching, and that despite their flaws, continued to be a great source of enjoyment for me.",
    "\n                Like so many other people have said, both Naruto & Naruto Shippuuden had the problem too much filler and it kinda baffled me when I was first watching the show but now that I have finished I am so grateful for the extra filler. The show is amazing and absolutely captivating to the point where when I finished the 500th episode of Shippuuden it felt like it was gone too soon.  Each and every ark is enjoyable and watching Naruto and his friends grow as time goes on is a heartwarming experience. Being able to now go back and watch filler episodes that I\n                  \n\nskipped when originally racing through the series to finish out what happens next is a blessing because I get to learn more about this incredible universe.\n\r\nI have watched anime that is enjoyable and anime that has provided me with a wide range of emotions, but no other series has amazed me to the point that this one has. Very well done from the studio behind this series.",
    "\n                I'm not one for long lengthily reviews, so I'll be brief. The complexity of the storyline weaved in Naruto Shippuden is a great advancement in depth and seriousness. A change reflective of the growth in the characters as well as the viewing audience. Darker, more extensive backstories are revealed with many a plot twist in addition to breath-taking advancements from the prequel. Once you begin watching this (assuming you've watched and enjoyed the first) you'll be engrossed. The only reason I wouldn't score the anime perfectly would be due to the frequency of less interesting fillers in the middle of arcs as well as the\n                  \n\nslow start before the real intensity and emotional depth takes hold in the plot.",
    "\n                Naruto Shippuden, in my opinion, is one of the best animes I watched here is why.\n\r\nFirst of lost character development from every character in the series.\n\r\nThe art was perfect in my opinion it could have been a bit better but I still think the art was great.\n\r\nThe sound was one of the best parts the endings and openings were amazing no disappointment at all.\n\r\nThe story and plot were both amazing and I didn't even mind the fillers but the flashbacks were annoying which is one of the naruto weaknesses.\n\r\nMy personal favorite was the pain arc but the war arc was a bit dragged but it\n                  \n\nended up being worth it at the end.\n\r\nOverall 10/10 Amazing anime.",
    "\n                It's hard, to sum up in words my experience watching Naruto Shippuden as a whole. This story is so in-depth and complex and just follows such an emotional, beautiful storyline that will have you falling in love with a multitude of characters. Alot of the characters have in-depth backgrounds that leave you speechless and sad. But, It's not just sadness this show has you feeling. This show leaves you flabbergasted with the amazing fights that show the pure determination of the main character. It's so rejuvenating to see how far Naruto himself has come since the original story. It makes you feel almost like a\n                  \n\nproud parent.  This story also had me laughing a lot of the time and even smiling from the goofy antics in this story.\n\r\nThis story is one about connections, to other people and how much they mean to you, and how far you're willing to go for them. It shows determination and loyalty, and love. This show has the story of two brothers and the hardships their relationship dealt with, and all of the hidden reasons behind their actions. This show and these characters made me understand the depth of brotherly, familial, and platonic love and how far it will take you. \n\r\nI have fallen in love with this world created in Naruto Shippuden and its wonderful stories, even the fillers I loved all of them. I will miss each and every one of them so much, and I'm so happy I got to experience it all. Overall, the main thing I learned from this show is Bonds and love. The bonds between Naruto and Sasuke, and between their friends. The bond between Sasuke and Itachi and how much they always loved each other. Many moments had me crying like a baby, losing characters I love, and just watching Naruto do many different things. Finally seeing him get married and become an adult made me so happy.\n\r\nPlease, watch this show. Maybe it's not for you, but, for me, it was a life-changing watch and I will always miss this world and its many characters.",
    "\n                At this point (ep 249/500 and having watched Naruto Original), i can safely say i am bored.I started watching this because its one of the most popular anime in the world and i thought i'd give it a go. The story is really good but its diluted by the fact i spent 20 eps watching filler of characters and places i dont care about and are not good to watch along with 20 further eps of filler AFTER the story arc of people and places i do not care about. Its a bitter sweet feeling as i do enjoy it but i am constantly riddled\n                  \n\nby the fact i cant be arsed. I truly believe that the score (8.26/100 as of now) is majorly inflated by people giving it 10/10s because of \"nostalgia\" which suggests it is perfect from start to finish. If they watched all 700 eps from start to finish i doubt they would get past naruto original. \n\r\nConclusion:\r\n1) Story is great when you get it. \r\n2) Characters are great when you care about them and actually see them again.\r\n3) Animation is great when it doesnt take a nose dive off a cliff.\r\n4) Could easily make it SIGNIFICANTLY shorter if you cut out half the filler, half the flashbacks and half the travelling which would make it much more enjoyable because it gets to the point. \r\n5) its just plain boring. not worthy of 10/10 even if it gives the improvements above.\n\r\nI wil finish it however and perhaps give another review if it is as good as people say it is. Thank god for characters like Itachi who made it mildly more interesting for a brief amount of time.\n\r\nNot Recommended (for now).\n\r\nThanks for reading purely my own opinion.",
    "\n                In spite of its flaws I think Naruto is a masterpiece. \r\nI just want to preface this by saying Naruto is what got me into anime. And because of that I have strong emotions attached to the series. But even as I have watched many more anime, some of which I think are far better than Naruto, this series has always been something special to me. And that is not because of my emotional attachment, but the incredible writing which Kishimoto consistently displays.\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nNaruto Shippuden gets a lot of hate these days and it's somewhat understandable why. A poor final villain and a final arc which\n                  \n\ndragged on, combined with a underwhelming sequel left a lot to be desired. But much of that hate comes from fundamental confusion about this complex series' themes, characters, and philosophies. Naruto Shippuden remains a great, often underrated, shounen, and a generally amazing anime overall, given you skip the filler. \r\nStory: The story starts off strong from the timeskip. The introduction of the akatsuki serves as a menacing and badass villain introduction. The first arc starts strong, building up tension to a climax, although it does struggle with it's pacing. The second arc is a satisfying and awesome way to reintroduce Sasuke as a character, and display his growth. Shippuden peaks in its writing from the Hidan and Kakuzu arc through the Five Kage Summit. Emotional character deaths, one of anime's best villains in Pain, and exceptional character development for the many characters serve as one of the most entertaining stretches in anime I have watched. Despite the initial quality, the 4th Great Shinobi War dips significantly in quality. The writing feels repetitive, and slow. I lost interest at some points and couldn't tell what was filler and not. Kaguya was one of the worst twists in any anime I have watched, but between that mess, there were still entertaining fights and moments.\u00a0It did not ruin the series and is still solid overall.\r\nAnimation: The animation normally ranges from mediocre to ok, but during important fight scenes (Kakashi vs Kakuzu, Sakura vs Sasori, Naruto vs Pain, Kakashi Vs Obito, Madara vs Shinobi Alliance) it delivers some of the most memorable hand to\u00a0 hand combat I have seen in anime. The animation alone often makes decent fights from the manga top tier. \r\nSound: The music is one of my favorite soundtracks in any anime period. The sound effects also work well.\u00a0Incredibly memorable, emotional, exciting, and intense.\r\nCharacters: Characters are perhaps Shippuden's strongest point. Kakashi, Gaara, Pain, and Itachi are characters people normally point to as their favorites. Even the often misunderstood female characters are well-written, especially Hinata, whose struggles with self-confidence I personally identify with.\r\n I\u2019m going to focus on just one character as an example of how incredible the series is:\r\nSasuke Uchiha . People criticize him for flip-flopping on his goals. But Sasuke always has realistic, thematically relevant reasons to do so. He is a dynamic character, who falls into hatred and revenge only to discover his purpose and attempt to lead the world in his own direction. He is exploited and tormented by adults like Itachi and Obito, and struggles to find his purpose. He hates the world and its corruption, and contemplates destroying the very village he grew up in. He hates himself and his weakness, and experiences depression, ptsd, and survivors guilt. But upon reanimating the Hokage and realizing what a true shinobi is, he prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice, in a Lelouch V Brittania like fashion, and take the world's hatred onto himself. In the end, he realizes he only wanted people to understand him, and that he could never find peace through loneliness. And after going on a journey for redemption, he resolves to protect the very village he wanted to destroy with his life.\r\nHere's why I personally find Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry/relationship so compelling: \r\nEven if you don't consider them rivals Naruto and Sasuke's relationship does a good job representing opposing real world philosophies, Sasuke's views could be compared to philosophers like Thomas Hobbes who believe that dictators are necessary to control humanity's evil nature, while Naruto represents a more optimistic outlook which argues for people's inherent goodness. It's a competition of ideals rather than just people\r\nRegardless, it's more complex than who is stronger. Perhaps you could even argue their rivalry is w/ fate itself, with both of them needing to overcome the destiny that they would fight and die in order to shape their ideal of a future. They continually fought agains the destiny which wanted to drive them apart and cause conflict yet they ended up becoming bros. I do think their rivalry is flawed however, and I wish it concluded with both making concessions to each other's arguments\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. \r\nI waited until my birthday, October tenth, to watch the final fight which is also on that day, 10/10, which is Naruto\u2019s birthday. \r\nThis series\u2019s strengths so overwhelmingly outweigh its flaws that just like Naruto and my birthdays it is a 10/10.",
    "\n                The original shonen jump Naruto was all around a very good show. Introduces us to the characters that we would be following for the next 719 episode across Naruto and Shippuden and it has some pretty great moments like the chunin exam arc and the land of waves arc. All around I thought it to be a great experience. Then I got to Shippuden and as soon as I finished it I had felt that I changed as a person after watching it. It is an absolute masterpiece and honestly Im mad at myself that I didnt watch this earlier because I only got into\n                  \n\nanime over quarantine like a lot of other people did. The story is honestly significantly more interesting than shonen jump because there was an actual story line instead of a bunch of random missions. The art at sometimes can be a little weird but that is made up for by the beautifully animated fight scenes and the animation gets significantly better towards the end. The characters for the most part are likeable but there are indeed some characters that you very much want to punt through a roof. Also, in my opinion, the biggest downside is that there are a significant number of characters that don't get developed enough and its mainly the girls which kind of leaves a bad taste. The openings and the ost are iconic. When you get to episode 54 and hear Blue Bird for the first time it just hits so different. Then one of my personal favorite moments when watching any anime was when I got to episode 380 and heard Silhouette for the first time because that song is an absolute banger. This show in my eyes is perfect and I get that this show can be viewed as very long by some people but you also gotta take into account that 41% of this show is filler which equates to about 205 episodes so you only need to watch 295 episode of this and they are all worth it. This is my favorite anime at the moment and I get that there might be better out there but as of right now I believe this is a true thing of beauty",
    "\n                I\u2019ve watched at least a hundred of animes and Naruto is the best among all of them. I started watching Naruto back in high school and now that I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s, I still enjoy watching it. I literally grew up watching Naruto and even if most people would say I\u2019m too old for this kind of thing, I can proudly say that I am a full-fledged diehard fan of Naruto.  I can imagine myself still watching Naruto with gray hair and wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of it. \n\r\nThere\u2019s a very long review coming for this is the review of one of the most famous\n                  \n\nanime in the history of anime and manga. \n\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nWhat I love most about Naruto is the story itself. I love how the story goes with every arc. How every mystery unfolds and questions answered, fits the main plot so well. Though the main storyline is influenced with strong drama, the story is made as light as possible. Every arc is packed with adventure, a little bit of romance, a comic relief, somewhat psychological touch, and tons of action. The fact that the story is very much exactly what is happening to the world, every viewer can really relate. War and dispute since ancient times is something that is, unfortunately, still happening up until now. You will see how war brings pain and sufferings and how these feelings make someone succumbs to the darkness.  You will witness how that darkness nurtures every villain in the story. You will also witness how the Shinobi World forced two best friends fight each other. It maybe a clich\u00e9 scenario but it is still made so original and magnificent that it didn\u2019t become so dramatic or over the top.  The heavy drama that comes with that kind of main plot is something that the viewers can really relate. This is the very reason why anime should not be considered as something that a child should only be watching. An argument that I\u2019ve been struggling to prove to my parents until now. What\u2019s more fascinating is the fact that this one is a lot better than the part I, well not that I love less the other one, but because Naruto and his friends are already young adults. The story is more mature and the main plot is explored more than the previous one where the focus was more on the adventure and transformation of the characters which is still significant because the series wouldn\u2019t be this great if the previous one wasn\u2019t successful enough. In this season, Naruto and his friends are old enough to realize the harsh reality of the Shinobi World and they have to do hard decisions for themselves. Like one of the famous caption in one of the manga\u2019s chapter, \u201cIT\u2019S COMING! SINCE THEY WERE BORN\u2026 THEY WILL EXPERIENCE WAR!\u201d. There are no dull or boring moments in this series which is one of the strongest and most important edge of this series from others even from the previous season. Even with the famous animes of today I occasionally get the feeling of boredom or worst just skip some scenes but in here it\u2019s different. Literally, every episode is so worth to watch and that\u2019s even with episode where Naruto is not even present. Lastly, the thing that amaze me the most are the dialogues. The dialogues are very well delivered which is very much rare for any other anime/manga of today. The dialogues in this series are not cheesy, over dramatic, and hypocritical. It is always delivered like it is from what a real person feels which make it so sincere. Especially Naruto\u2019s. They will definitely move you. In my many years of watching animes and mangas, this series have the most admirable and amazing lines and dialogues of all time, one of the biggest reasons why Naruto is so memorable.\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nThe characters are very much well-explored; you can\u2019t help but have a favorite. You can see how another character influences every action of another. In my lists are the kind-hearted and good role model sensei Kakashi and Jiraiya, the cool and quiet Gaara, the very smart and cool Shikamaru, the rest of Naruto\u2019s friends in Konoha, and of course, one of the most scary and powerful villains among the animes of today, the Akatsuki. In this series, you will see how villains genuinely become a bad guy and not just a clich\u00e9 reason for doing bad things. You will witness how an individual succumbs to their hatred almost like in the real world. One of my personal favorites is Itachi who has done a lot. He is the epitome of selflessness. Too bad that the truth about him is used by Madara as to manipulate Sasuke and even more hate Sasuke for being manipulated. It\u2019s as if he wasted all Itachi\u2019s sacrifices when he let Madara used him when Itachi never wanted his brother be touch by Madara. By the way, can\u2019t wait to see about the truth behind what Itachi gave Naruto during their last encounter and how Sasuke will react when he finds out.  Madara, who turn out to be the true villain of the series or so we thought as there is still shocking revelations later in the series. As one of the calmest villain yet have a very dark and nasty intention, Madara is one of those truly irritating villains. Lastly, I genuinely love the character of Mighty Guy. He is flamboyant and somewhat serve as a comic relief of the series. But what\u2019s so ironic but most of the times hilarious, is that for some reason you feel assured whenever Guy is fighting. He may be hilarious but he is certainly one powerful guy.\n\r\nAbout UZUMAKI NARUTO\r\nIf you would look at it more, Naruto has a lot more reasons to hate the world compared to Sasuke. But you see, their difference is that Naruto let others in. Unlike Sasuke, Naruto opens up to others and let them be part of his life and because of that, he grows up with a strong heart and will. Naruto, influences almost every person around him. Although, sometimes I can feel how he can get a little bit hypocrite especially regarding Sasuke. But then at the end of the day I would end up admiring him for having such pure strong will. I guess that\u2019s exactly the reason why people around him change for the good. With regards to this, I love the opening of the series with Diver theme because it very much explains how Naruto survives despite having misfortunate life particularly from his childhood days. Even if saving Sasuke drowns him with so much pain and despair, all his loved ones pushes him back on track so he won\u2019t drown with too much hatred like Sasuke did. Nevertheless, I strongly admire him for having so much faith in Sasuke. Even I hate Sasuke but Naruto\u2019s character manages to justify his unconditional loyalty to Sasuke. His character matures a lot after the death of Jiraiya and the assault on Konoha where he was considered a Hero.\n\r\nAbout UCHIHA SASUKE\r\nFrom being the most famous character of the series, he completely becomes the most evil and extremely irritating villain of all time. And when I say turn of personality, its 180 degrees opposite of his previous character. He really does look like a possess person, from facial expressions to body language.  Sasuke is the embodiment of the word \u201cHATRED\u201d. At the end of every episode you would have conflicting emotions. There\u2019s this feeling where you sympathizes with Naruto for wanting to save his lost friend and there\u2019s this strong feeling of hating Sasuke for being the source of everyone\u2019s agony especially Naruto. I hate Sasuke so much! Hate him for having a weak heart. All he needed was a little push and he was already manipulated. He is so na\u00efve and easily dyed with other\u2019s colors. This is the difference between him and Itachi because despite everything else Itachi walk the path that he believes in. Just for the record, I think Itachi experienced a lot more compared to Sasuke because he was the one who killed all his brethren. Despite that, he did all those things with his own resolve and not because he was being manipulated. That\u2019s precisely why Madara was afraid of Itachi because he can\u2019t use Itachi. I admire people who do things with their own resolve, whether it is right or wrong for others, at least they stand up for what they believe in. Sasuke just nurtured and nurtured his hatred. For that his really immature just like a child. That's why Madara enjoyed manipulating him because his so easy to push.\n\r\nAbout NARUTO AND SASUKE\r\nNaruto and Sasuke\u2019s extremely complicated relationship has always been one of the strongest and most interesting parts of the series. Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s suffering since childhood our almost the same, in fact, Naruto has a lot more reasons to have such hatred but because he has a strong heart he managed to survive that darkness. Sasuke maybe be so strong abilities-wise but when it comes to a strong heart Naruto can survive anything. Sasuke is so damn na\u00efve and can be dyed with any color. He is such a brat swayed by his emotions that\u2019s why he is easily manipulated by Madara. On the other hand, Naruto can be na\u00efve also with a lot of things but definitely have a strong heart. You can even consider that he already has a color that defines him and won\u2019t be deceive by others. He won\u2019t let other\u2019s beliefs sway his way of life. Most probably this is the very reason why Itachi entrusted Sasuke to Naruto. Well, I guess at the end of the day I hate Sasuke for the simple reason as being the main source of Naruto\u2019s sufferings but at the same time I also thank him for being the source of Naruto\u2019s strength and strong will to move forward. You will have conflicting feelings whether to hate or pity Sasuke but in my case I hate him 75% and pity him 25%. After struggling to choose, you will realize how deeply involved you are already with the story. Follow the manga version to know the real details of Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s fate and like me you will die in anticipation. I just can\u2019t wait to see who will win, Sasuke who carries the curse of hatred or Naruto who carries the will of fire both from their ancestors. I want to see, if Naruto can really save Sasuke and if he does, I want to see how. Even if it takes many years, I will wait for that destined clash. And I strongly believe that it is one of the most awaited moments in the series that everyone is just dying to see. But still, at the end of the day, I feel so sad that both of them became victims of the shinobi world and now facing each other. It\u2019s almost like a sin how Mr. Kishimoto is able to create such brilliant story. \n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\r\nThe animation is just so great and matures with every year. There are always developments and improvements as the years go by. Not all series is blessed with magnificent cool stunts and captivating visual effects. The illustrations and artwork are one of the best. Breath-taking landscapes and amazing looking characters. Oh! Did I mention there are endless heart-pounding and cool fight scenes? Also love the sounds because it\u2019s very ninja-like which makes it the series\u2019 own unique sound.  I even have a collection of Naruto\u2019s soundtracks. Lastly, the dialogue is very original which is very important for me because sometimes the lines are the ones that stays in your mind and would make you remember a character.\n\r\nI can\u2019t even find a single flaw from this series which is extremely rare when I\u2019ve already watched so many different animes. From characters to animation to music to seiyus to dialogues and most importantly to the STORY, I just can\u2019t find a flaw.  With that all said, I strongly believe that I was able to explain why this anime has been in the number one spot for so many years in my lists of top 100 best animes. For me, this is the ultimate and epitome of anime viewing of my more than a decade anime experience. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve lived to see such creation.",
    "\n                (This review may contain SPOILERS) Fillers... Fillers Everywhere...\n\r\nStory 7\r\nLeaving the fillers aside (because it would 1/10) Naruto Shippuuden has a giant world with fun and interesting ninja system, even making an interesting world the author left several plot holes and some very convenient things, like a mask that liberated the spirits Sealed of past Hokages by Shinigami Shiki Fujin, and a character who had a jutsu of resuscitation who were never cited before, why didn 't Danzo make his move after the third Hokage died? Villains with very weak motivations...\n\r\nArt 7\r\nTwo Words = Studio Pierrot, As Naruto one of the bestsellers should have received special\n                  \n\ncare, several fights mainly Naruto x Pain had a low-level animation, which worsened even more in the Great Ninja War\n\r\nSound 8\r\nLike Classic Naruto, We have several strong music, continuing with the typical Japanese instruments and sometimes a good guitar solo.\n\r\nCharacters 6\r\nNaruto continues the same noisy Brat always trying to convince the opponent that he is wrong with a sermon, Sakura really grew but continues with that same stereotype annoying tsundere, Sai and Yamato made an \r\ninteresting adhesion, were characters who knew we could Expect something,. Shikamaru, Guy and Kakashi still funny, Kiba, Rock Lee, Hinata (Naruto-kun, Naruto-kun, Kurosaki-kun,) And all other ninjas have had the potential wasted. Now the villains, isn't there some kind of Psichologist Ninja in this world? Most villains seem to do bad things because they are misunderstood or suffered trauma from the past \"The girl i have a Crush who never gave me attention died what I do now? I know, I'm going to extinguish the human race.\" Really ????\n\r\nEnjoyment 7\r\nYou can get bored with Naruto's obsession with Sasuke, or Naruto solving the problems with a conversation that his path is right and the opponent is wrong, he does it three or four times, the plot holes, but it is undeniably a great Shounen Show by the fights and interactions between some characters.",
    "\n                Good : \n\r\nInteresting premise and world, magic system that allows for many enjoyable fights, interesting character designs, characters with relatable motives.\n\n\r\nBad :\n\r\n-Characters\n\r\nNaruto :\n\n\n  a)He started as a likeable kid with troubled life that could be overbearing at times but tried his best. He became annoying when he would spout the same things over and over again while never actuall achieving anything , diving head first into the enemy without thinking and getting his ass kicked.\r\n  b)In Shippuden he shed that immaturity and became more bearable.\r\nUnforutnately he still had his dumb moments that completely messed the tone in many instances. His immaturity also clashes with the tone and style of the rest of the series. Characters like Luffy are ok to be \"dumb\" because the whole world of the manga is kind of silly and ridiculous with over the top scenarios, locales and cahracters. Every character on his crew is a bit of a nut in their own way, and many characters in the rest of the series are too so it doesnt feel out of place. But it does in Naruto.\r\n  c)Also he was still an almost useless fighter. Sasuke had managed half a dozen different Jutstus in the 2 year timeskip, Naruto not only learned nothing but he couldnt even do rasengan without a clone.\r\nApart from Pain he never had a decent fight with an equal oppoenent to show his skills and competence. After that he just uses the Fox which throws most ninja techniques out the window.\n\n\r\n-Sakura :\r\nMost annoying character and impossible to like.\r\nHas an unhealthy obsession over Sasuke, even after all his crimes and attempts to kill her making her look like an unhinged ex-girlfirend with Battered Wife Synrome than an independent strong character.\r\nThe antics with Naruto where she gets angry and slaps him were never funny, just cringy and annoying making her look like a bitch.\n\r\n-Sasuke\r\nHe started off interesting if a little emo.\r\nHe opened up, he made friends, but had to leave them for his own purposes. Ok so far.\r\nAftet the 2 year timeskip he goes full-on edgy emo and tries to kill them for no good reason. It made sense to abandon them in favor of training under Orochimaru, not kill them.\r\nHe puts on a permament poker face being unable to show any emotion at any time.\r\nPlus after al the shit he did, he was forgiven way too easily.\n\r\n-Hinata\r\nAnnoying too high pitched voice even after she became a teen, too timid even for a timid personality, too obsessed with Naruto, barely any good interaction between them.\n\r\n-Karin\r\nThat was a big missed opportunity. After she as almost killed by Sasuke her dialogue made it sound like she realised the truth and would forget Sasuke coming to her senses. She observed Naruto and how he was so much \"brighter\" than Sasuke. Given how they were also form th same clan it was a ripe opportunity for interesting character development betweeen them.\r\nNaruto could realise he was not alone, Karin the same. They could become close, bond over their troubled childhoods and support each other in the coming battles.\r\nBut her character was wasted and the very next scene with her, she just still craves Sasuke's dick for some reason.\n\n\r\n-battles :\r\nThat was hit n' miss.\r\nSome fights, especiallu the early ones were interesting with various strategies and techniques being used in creative ways to make dynamic battles.\r\nWhile however some characters like Sasuke or Shikamaru were given interesting fights, the protagonist himself Naruto most of the time had lame ones. Others like Lee, had onnly brute force but ultilised it in the same way we see Chackie CHan and other artists use it in fulm so it was entertaining.\r\nNaruto offered none of the 2 : neither brain fights nor strength fights\r\nHe usually just used brute force instead of his brain, even when the opponents were much stronger and it was obvious it wasnt working.\r\nHe never learned any elements to supplement his arsenal, he never improved upon them.\r\nHE learned th wind elements which he used to create his super rasengan and then he totally forgot about it. he didnt create any new technique that was less dangerous than that.\r\nHe went from 0-100 with no in-between.\r\nTowards the end, the ninja fitghts are almost gone and we just have gods playign with each other so...whatever.",
    "\n                This anime is truly amazing.\n\r\nfirst i will start off with the negatives about this anime. there are wayyyyy to many fillers and some parts you really just want to skip because it's slow. I myself stopped watching occasionally but was determined to finish. at first i wanted to watch every single episode but i couldn't do it tbh.\n\r\nbut overall, this anime is one of my favorites. it's such a good mixture and if you watch all of it out you will enjoy it so much. it's a literal emotional rollercoaster. you'll cry and you'll laugh and you'll be so happy and angry and sad all\n                  \n\nat the same time. in my opinion, the main characters progress so much and it's really worth it to see them go through this whole process to get where they are in the anime rn.\n\r\nso please watch it. you won't regret it.",
    "\n                Overall, the series had a good plot with twist and turns, though a bit clich\u00e9. The main thing that would turn people away is the length of the anime, the amount of filler, the amount of episodes dedicated to flashbacks that have already been shown.\n\r\nThe art style was pretty good for an anime so long, being simple but enough for viewers to be able to clearly differentiate characters. There are some things in the art style that did tick me off though, like the different types of eyes - they weren't very consistent in design (some had pupils, others didn't). Also, there was the questionable\n                  \n\nhair colours.\n\r\nThe soundtrack was the best part of Naruto Shippuden or Naruto in general. The music was really good - opening songs and ending songs were upbeat and lively (most) and the music was really good at setting the mood for the scene. One thing I did not like was the fact some characters got more than one theme song while other 'still important' characters didn't get one.\n\r\nCharacter development continued throughout the course of the plot unless they died or went away. Character development was mostly shown through flashbacks (one of the anime's favourite things to do) and interactions. Some characters even had a season dedicated to their life story. There was something I was sad about however - it was the fact a particular character was given a substantial amount of character development, and everyone had high hopes for them when suddenly, the creator kills them off for the sake of the next series \"Boruto\". Like 'bam' they died and an OTP was gone, all the character development was gone.\n\r\nI did enjoy the series though with it's funny parts and serious parts, though during the series I felt like screaming because of the characters actions/stupidity/naivety.",
    "\n                The only reason i gave story 9/10 is because of the filler. Other than this though, I think Naruto Shippuuden (and Naruto) is the best anime ever. The arcs are amazing with impactful villains and great heroes. The character development (even though the filler can be a little excessive is great). It made you love all of the characters and made you feel like you lost someone close when they died. It also makes you excited when Naruto overcomes a weakness and defeats a great enemy. Some people think this is just plot armor but I personally think it makes more a great story (like\n                  \n\nin dragon ball). The action is amazing and is greatly complemented by the soundtrack. It may use the same song a lot, but once you here that one song you get a great feeling and you know something great is about to happen. This anime makes you sad and happy.  I would recommend this anime to all anime watchers and i give it and the original Naruto a ten out of ten.",
    "\n                Naruto, one of those legends in japanimation. No need to introduce it at this point... So for starters, I'll just say that this review will focus more on the anime aspect than on the story, which comes from the manga.\r\nI personnally really liked the manga, at least until the Pain arc.\n\n\r\nSTORY\r\nLong story short, it depends on the arc. This should be something obvious today : when making literally HUNDREDS of episodes, you can't hit a perfect score. There are some very good arcs and some much less interesting.\n\r\nMain strong point : from all those long-sh\u00f4nen anime/manga, Naruto is the most consistent, telling a straight story\n                  \n\n(from A to Z, without much detour).\n\r\nMain weakness : the fillers. There are WAY TOO MUCH and some of them have to be watched as they contain bits of the canon story.\n\n\r\nART\r\nThis is what matters when making an anime adaptation of a manga. And I'll be blunt : the visuals were way too screwed up for me to enjoy Naruto.\r\n- First, the drawings : they are way too simple. There are too few traits, and the colors are way too \"unicolor\".\r\n- Then, the animation : this really depends on the episode. Some fights are simply amazing, but some of them are screwed up.\r\n- Finally, there are no light effects (which is why it is all \"unicolor\").\n\r\nBasically, the visuals are way too simple and irregular.\n\n\r\nSOUND\r\nTakanashi is a genius of music. The OST is great, although if I had to compare with Fairy Tail, I would prefer the latter because of the style. I'm not really fan of the \"ninja music style\" from Naruto...\r\nAs for the openings, there are so many...! Some of them are really good, some are not really memorable. I personnally really like the FLOW and Asian Kung-Fu Generation openings.\r\nOverall it is really satisfying.\n\n\r\nCHARACTER\r\nAgain, I won't really develop that point. Some of the characters are awesome, but I do feel like they could have done a better job with all those secondary characters. Naruto's friends aren't really interesting most of the time.\n\n\r\nENJOYMENT\r\nToo many fillers, visuals too simple, and an overall resullt way too irregular. Because of those points, I really didn't enjoy the anime of Naruto. I do like some parts of the manga, and I was really expecting a lot from some arcs in the anime version, but wound up disappointed because the animation is sometimes awful.",
    "\n                You know, to be honest, I stared at this blank slate of a review box trying to discern the best way to start this review. I mean, the first thing you see when you come across the review is the score and the profile picture. And, with all the positive reviews praising this shonen manga, I felt I had to present the other side, an argument forsook and abandoned by many Naruto fans. Now, keep in mind. I enjoyed the manga. The manga was good. The anime is different for a number of reasons, but in some cases I will address both as a whole\n                  \n\nand the problems I see in them. Also, do keep in mind this is my opinion, an opinion that goes against the Naruto fandom ship. So, if you hate me for it, that's completely understandable, just leave a comment explaining why.\n\r\nStory (4/10) In a nutshell, Naruto has one of the most deus ex machina filled plots with a hearty helping of Christopher Nolan (aside from the HxH plagiarism, of course).  A bad summary would entail the following: a masochistic, prepubescent ninja sets off on his grand quest to retrieve his beloved rival (whom he shared intimate kisses) and defeat all who oppose his dream: converting Konoha village to the Dattebayo! religion. Well, that really doesnt do the show justice, but the hilarity of it stems from how true it may seem. A young ninja named Naruto whose dream is to become Hokage through a number of deus ex machina and turning each and every villain into a contrived ally. Also, lets not leave out the fact that this is essentially a discount Hunter x Hunter. A young boy sets out to surpass his father (Gon/Killua - Naruto) goes through an intense physical exam (Hunter Exam/Chuunin Exam) where he meets the main antangonist (Hisoka/Oorchimaru) trains to become better while the other character (Sasuke/Kurapika) wants revenge on the extinction of his tribe (Scarlet tribe/ Sharigan clan) for the harvesting of their powers (that one guy with the sharigans in his arms/ everyone collecting the Scarlet eyes). Oh, lets not forget both eyes are special and red. Clearly not downright plagiarism right?\n\r\nArt (7/10) The art style was very unique. Instead of switching to the crisp, overused layouts as is done today in most anime, Naruto delivers a more Edo-period type feel. For example, compare it to Toei Animation's One Piece and you will clearly see the difference. The series itself leads into a feel only known and beget to the series. Other than that, the fight scenes are well done, yet there are parts which seem a little choppy, mostly because of the feel aspect and not relying on super-crisp animation. Other than that, I love the animation.\n\r\nSound (8/10) This is an area of great controversy. The background music, fight music, emotional settings and light-hearted tones fit well within the series. I can definitely concur with that. However, some openings and endings did not fit the show at all, namely Blue Bird and \"You are my FRIEND AH UGHGH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH\" God, <sigh> did anyone else hate that one. Aside from that, the only other problem I have are the voice actors, namely Naruto himself. I usually dont agree with this subject but I sadly find the dubbed version to suit him better than the Japanese one. Not because of the voice alone. The actor/actress seems to fail to capture all that naruto stands for within the voice acting and intonation. Maybe, its because of the script and the use of certain japanese characters which dont fit but the voice actors are asked to improvise the script itself, .....so there. I'm an asshole Naruto fans....forgive me for having an opinion.\n\r\nCharacter (4/10) Aside from a specific few, there is very very little character development for a show this long. The show and manga seem to address a huge cast of actors, which they subsequently throw away for the sake of plot progression. I would like to say it pulled of the \"Angel Beats academy of unknown side characters\" but Angel beats is phenomenal and Naruto is older.....hence naruto is to blame and is now the entitled founder of said academy. Look at Shikamaru, look at the rest of the teams. The only thing remediable is their powers, which already is over used and such forth. Remember Hinata's confession and how it was never addressed afterwards by any character in both the anime and manga? Yep, some good development we got here. Also, ughghgh.....Naruto and Sasuke. The whole thing is a sin. It's unbelievable, it goes against Naruto's dream fundamentally, and is essentially a discount Christopher Nolan. The only thing stopping it from being a full-on Christopher Nolan is a bookshelf and someone randomly yelling, \"MUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRPH!\" Good movie by the way, watch it if you haven't.\n\r\n Enjoyment (3/10) This is actually going to be the shortest thing I will address because my view on this area is surprisingly popular. The anime is 3/10 because....fillers. By the time Luffy becomes the Pirate King, Naruto would become the filler king. The manga is a 5/10 for the above reasons only...thats about it.\n\r\nOverall (5/10) In summary, this was a dreadful piece of work. Why? Three main reasons: unplanned, fanservice, and deus ex machinas all over the place. Naruto was not forethought. In the end battle alone, the main antagonist shifted three times!!!! That shouldnt happen. Even if everyone is yelling PLOT TWIST! Nonsense....it is a cop out ending in all respects to writing and literature works. Two. Fanservice. Naruto is surprisingly popular. I really don't understand why. Maybe because of its shonen serialization or its overhyped commercialization....either way its still sinful. The show still hasnt ended, yet the manga has ended over two years ago. The movie ended the manga at a good place, I will give it that. However, now I have to deal with another serialization about Boruto and Co. Freakin money and its crappy influence. Third, EX MACHINAS! This show literally couldnt put more deus ex machinas even if it tried. It's complete crap. The use of tropes and moral punchlines is all wrong. Every good well-developed villain becomes a side-character on the force of good after meeting Naruto. Its awful. Its a Christopher Nolan performance.......of cheesiness and cop out endings and fillers. Also, the fanbase against this argument is toxic. A perfect example is Double4anime. Just watch him on youtube and how butthurt he gets when someone despises his beloved Naruto. Bottom line, would I recommend this show? not the show but the manga, but then I will provide ten more that automatically beat it as an example of \"here's anime done wrong, and here's ten done right.\" Phew, that was long. I apologized if I offended anyone with this long digression. If you like the show, thats perfectly ok. However, be aware of the wrong things with it and accept it instead of ignorantly covering your ears and hate spamming. Is my opinion right? No! Absolutely not. This is a biased opinion of everything wrong with Naruto. And although I tried to be impartial, it was still a partial review for which I duly apologize. So, if you feel butt hurt, read a positive review. There's literally thousands of 10/10 reviews out there. So there. I hope you enjoyed it!",
    "\n                Naruto Shipuuden is a bit overrated by most, and underrated by few, then there are people like me that'll tell you the truth.  Im going to be harsh in this review... im going to keep it as real as I can. Im TELLING YOU do not believe the 10s this show is getting... you'll love it at first... then realize the show is WAAAY over-stretched and rips of plenty of other shows, and that it isnt the best anime out there... especially for shounen. So watch it! I insist! but dont get your hopes up.\n\r\nNaruto Shipuuden/Naruto (lets call it naruto) is known by many,\n                  \n\nloved by many, and hated by many. I watched all of naruto and im currently waiting for these damn kakashi fillers to be done. Thats what stops this anime from being complete..... fillers...  And lets not forget how much ripoff this anime does to EVERYTHING else. but enough with ranting... lets get to the rating...\n\r\nStory.(6) \r\nThe story is ok, but kind of cliche  when you think about the basics.... Super hidden powers for some unknown reason (DBZ gohan/ssj in the first place) then we have the weird love traingle that pisses me, and i bet many others off...(do I even have to mention a specific anime? its everywhere) baby trauma (DBZ goku being brought to a new planet) etc. etc. Besides that its good. you know... striving to be the best (Pokemon Ash) and finally HE DOES THE SAME ARM BEHIND THE HEAD LIKE GOKU!!! EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! he even does the -_- eyes like brock does from pokemon. \n\r\nArt(7) simple but good. not much to say here.\n\r\nSound(7) again simple but good...\n\r\nCharacter(5) i've already pointed out all the cliche stereotypes I can... poor characters that piss you off and it seems characters just come and go whenever the story needs them... where the hell is everyone unless you need them? \"uhhh training?\"\n\r\nEnjoyment(6) I really cant give the show the benefit of the doubt when EVERYONE fanboys over it. I have to keep it as real as possible. Now Im not saying this isnt a good show to watch when your new to anime... but saying its your favorite, giving it a ten, etc.etc. just shows how noobie you are in the vast world of anime.\n\r\nOverall(6)",
    "\n                Subjective in my opinion\r\n- 8/10 Good theme, about ninjas with their great moves.\r\n- 8/10 Good organizational and social systems and explained very clearly\r\n- 8/10 Very interesting skill system,\r\n- 6/10 Plot twist, most of the stories have no surprises and are easy to guess.\r\n- 7/10 Ordinary MC character (naive as usual).\r\n- 9/10 The introduction of each character and skill is very good so that each character has their own unique moves.\r\n- 8/10 Good MC portion, the story runs parallel and how MC is in the story is very natural.\n\r\n10/10 Resurrection Skill and the 4th ninja world war. this is a uniqueness that other anime don't have,\n                  \n\nif there was no Resurrection then the 4th ninja world war wouldn't be that great. and this is a brilliant idea to bring back dead characters and make the war even greater.",
    "\n                This series is a spectacle in the shounen genre. Let us not mince words!! This show succeeds in utilizing its cast of secondary characters due to a long episode count and filler episode budget that the animation studio has. Battle sequences are epic where new abilities need to be learned for our main character to keep up with the looming threats wanting to destroy the shinobi world. The villains in Naruto are very fleshed out. Naruto Shippuuden gets you invested in the main characters and rooting for them quickly into the first Akatsuki onslaught. The filler episodes fall into the \"hit-or-miss\" category, so if you\n                  \n\nare watching for the story or over-the-top shounen fights, you might wanna have a list of filler episodes ready so that you can accelerate thru the long episode count. I don't suggest marathoning such a long-running shounen; save your sanity. But this shounen is worth the watch!!"
