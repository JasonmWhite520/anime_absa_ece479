In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.\n\r\nStory (8): The first half of this anime is a masterpiece. The concept itself - the Shinigami's notebook which grants the person who has it the power to kill anyone by simply writing the person's name while picturing the face in his mind - is already brilliant to begin ",
    "\n                There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Not",

DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. \n\r\nThe art wasn't that great, but I sure did like this anime anyway. \n\r\nThe sound was fitting; it suited the tense atmosphere and scenes. \n\r\nThe characters were all intriguing and deep, especially Light.

The side characters also further build the story-telling. Objectively if we see, there are many other animes that have as good a plot as this, but Death Note wins over them all if we include the OST. The music is extremely well-suited and blends beautifully throughout each episode of the series, aiding the story telling and unique character development. Con",

The music is outstanding, and the characters are awesome- the  character development is amazing and we get a true glimpse into each character's true identities. \r\nWhat bumps it up to a 10 is the amount symbolism in the OP, foreshadowing and the effects of the death note on the users and the one's around them.\r\nDeath note is definitely in my holy trinity o",
    "\n                Death Note is one of the best and most amazing anime I have ever seen!  My anime rating is 98%, (2nd place in the top 10 anime list).\n\r\nStory : 10/10 \r\nThe story is a masterpiece and a great genius from the author, I have never seen a similar story, intelligence plays a large role in the story and this is what makes it really special.\n\r\nArt : 10/10 \r\nDrawing and animation is very excellent, although it is considered an old (2006) anime, its production is better than the current 2020 anime.\n",
    "\n                Despite Death Note's solid main cast of characters, great soundtrack, strong visual symbolism, strong thematic ideas and at times clever plot points, I still do not enjoy it. My problem lies with how much exposition and dialogue plays integral roles in developing the narrative, crushing the pacing and storytelling in the process. The problem magnifies when not every part of this series is as clever and intricate as it attempts to express. Intelligence and calculation are the pillars of this",

    "\n                Extremely outstanding anime it's my first anime to watch, this is the anime I chose to begin my journey into the anime world, definitely worth watching. The story is so perfect and unique and requires a high IQ to understand, the main character got some nice development, it might be old but Death Note will always remain in the top no matter how many animes shows up. This anime considered as the beginning for many anime fans, the only small little downside is that some characters won't make "
