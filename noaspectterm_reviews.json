    "e another sports series of this season did.\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is not for everyone. This show is dumb, but it meant to be dumb, it wants to be dumb and it's proud of it. The ones who will appreciate it the most are the ones who're somewhat deep into the medium and seen some series this makes fun of and seen the biggest hits of the past few years, because Keijo is really heavy in references. It's an easy on the mind show with high entertainment value. I recommend it to everyone who has an open mind.",

    "You know, if you rearrange the letters in Keijo, you can get another world that describes it better... Kojei: which means shit in Okinawan. \n\n\r\nKeijo is like a bad gag gift. Some gag gifts can be funny, because they put the recipient in a situationally funny or embarrassing position in front of a bunch of people, like getting some sexy underwear and a dildo. Except you're a guy. And the lingerie won't fit. So what do you do? You just throw that shit in the trash, and move on with your life, just like Keijo.",
    "/background tracks that stand out during climactic scenes. The sound design though: That's where this show shines. KEIJO!!!!!!!! uses sound in some pretty unique ways that are genuinely hilarious. You'll hear mechanical sounds, explosions, energy pulses and everything in between when various ass-centric attacks are used, and during combat every fight in this series is full of other varied and exaggerated impact sounds.\n\r\nSo, is this how one saves anime?\r\nDoes this series do what none before it could?\n\r\nYes.",

That being said, having an average IQ will allow you to enjoy the surface level of ascension that Keijo!!!!!!!! has to offer.\n\r\nAll in all, this show was very entertaining, I enjoyed the animation and and the premise was creative enough to keep me captivated throughout the entire series.\n\r\nAnd now, a poem to round off my review of Keijo!!!!!!!! which interestingly enough acts as my final verdict for the show:\n\r\nRoses are Red\r\nKeijo!!!!!!!! is great\r\nThe girls in the show will make you ejaculate",

She is incredibly kawaii and makes\n                  \n\nmy heart go doki doki, heh. But in all seriousness, the way the world is built around these strong independent young ladies makes my head spin with anticipation for what will come next. Who will win? Who will lose? Well, in any case, there are neither winners or losers in Keijo!!!!!!!!!! there are only the friends we've made along the way.",
    " real, 10/10 would watch again.)\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 [Overall Decimal 9.65/10]\n\r\nI loved this show. Binged the whole thing in about 6 hours, and dayum it was a 6 hours well spent. And anytime I google \"{series name} season 2\" before I even mark it as finished on MAL, I know it's a keeper.\r\nThis was a thoroughly entertaining show, with comedy, ecchi, story, suspense and buildup. Can't wait for a second season, if and when there is one; and without a shadow of a doubt this was one of the top anime of the season!",
    "n to.\n\r\nOverall, Keijo!!!!!!!! is a really fun and enjoyable anime to watch, given that you denies all the logic and reason when watching it. It is a perfect anime for boobs and asses connoisseur who want to see what such magnificent body parts could achieve more. It is not an anime for everyone tho, people who despise fanservice might hate it to the core, dissing it for its ridiculous, poor story and absurd theme. But in the end of the day, it is a fanservice anime, and I can say it does its job well done.",
    "amount of fun to watch. I enjoyed the fanservice, I was rooting for my favourite girls to win and I laughed my ass off (hehe, ass) at all the over the topness. Keijo is the epitome of what some consider \"brainless fun\". This anime does not try to be the next Evangelion or Madoka or whatever, it wants to provide entertainment and goddammit, does it succeed. Absolute recommendation for everybody (unless you think female bodies are sexist, in which case you can go die for all I care).\r\n10/10\n\r\nOverass:\r\n7.4/10",
    "ect score ! At times you will notice (areas) are not as detailed or deflate in some scenes. \n\r\nSound: Epic, enough said.\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: This anime is so great you will need to\n                  \n\npause just to get a grip on reality due to the creativity level that is packaged in each episode. Loved how they implemented humor in a serious and non so serious fashion.\n\r\n Overall: Highly recommend this anime to open minded individuals or watch it with an open minded friend, trust me your in for a blast !",

At least they selling their enemy move so hard and can make their enemy look believable strong \r\n- Nobody want to be announcer for their match ? I miss announcer play by play for sports anime\n\r\nThis series is enjoyable with all ridiculous spot and their behavior. But this series just not for everyone.",
    "example, perhaps the genre as a whole would at least receive less negative reception and not be treated with little more than passing apathy. You don't have to be an ecchi fan to submerge yourself in Keijo!!, it should prove itself to be a refreshing endeavor with the usual elements working harmoniously for once. \n\r\nIt might just be an ever so small gem, but it is to be cherished. One cannot simply deny that Keijo!! is both sexy, and awesome! \n\r\nNot unless, of course, you happen to be a... dishonest cretin.",
    "ment:\r\nHavent' had this amount of fun for quite some time, and pretty much watched last episodes on the edge of my seat.\n\r\nOverall:\r\nThe only reason why someone would want to avoid it if they absolutely can't stand butt/boob jokes (there are a LOT of those) or has aversion to butts. Despite premise that looks like it was built for fanservice, the anime has fairly innocent feeling about it. \n\r\nHighly recommended. I think that anime coudl be interested to fans of many genres (ecchi, comedy, sports, fighting).",

Without ass there is no you, no me, no anyone. And thus we arrive a the importance of ass. While ass represents life, tits represent nurture. Both are essential to successfully raise a child. So you are asking me if a show that features the power and beauty of the ass and tits is worth watching? I think you know the answer.",
    "ghting stories I've watched.  \n\r\nI've also not laughed this hard in a while, all the puns and callbacks to various other anime for special attack names.\n\r\nThis has been one of the very few anime I've watched where they've integrated several regional accents and not just the one girl who's only job is comic relief.  The world feels a lot more lived in this way.\n\r\nJust good clean fun.\n\r\nThis\n                  \n\none should have gotten at least a second season.  Instead we get yet another DBZ/Naruto boringness.",

But it wasn't. No, its not a masterpiece that will make you re-evauate your life (not even close bitch) but I believe its still worth a watch. I've seen shiitier and it was probably one of the best shows of its season anyway.\n\r\nAfter all, shows like this are the saviours of anime.\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",
    "in the end, is Keijo worth picking up? Depends. It belongs to three genres (ecchi, comedy and sports) and all three are there to carry along the plot. Unless you hate fanservice, sport-animes, an inexplicable female-only cast or shounen-style fights with the power of friendship, I would say go for it. It will drag you along for twelve episodes with a permanent grin on your face. You can say whatever you want about it, but they sure did their best to make it as entertaining as possible without once slipping.",
    "t is very weird and I like weird. I feel some of the dialogue could have been more interesting (in certain conversations with certain characters). Otherwise, the logic from my brain has been drained and turned into a butt.\n\r\nI recommend if you\u2019re looking for something that makes sense, then you\u2019re definitely in the wrong place.

    "sport about butts and boobs. Well, at least until you see a girl use her hardened nipple to throw her opponent overhead. Then it becomes obvious that this series is a satire on Shounen through and through. Anyway, If you\u2019re looking for something more along those lines this season, then perhaps a slower show such as March Comes in like a Lion or a light-hearted piece like Yuri!! on Ice is more up your alley.\n\r\n-- Palpable =D\n\r\nFor more reviews like this, you can visit my blog at palpableemotion.wordpress.com",

The answer is one which\n                  \n\ntitillates both your mind and your loins. \n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch it now.\n\r\nNow I was going to end it there but this dumbass site needs me to write a longer review.",
    " Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show's genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So,\n\r\nIf you can handle gratuitous sexuality as a gateway to great shounen entertainment, you should absolutely watch this show. Leave your shame behind, and enjoy the ridiculousness. It's okay.\n\r\nIf you are tentative about that, perhaps try the first episode. You'll quickly decide for yourself whether its your type of show or not. You don't have to like it. It's okay.",

This show never takes itself too seriously and it was perfect for the ridiculousness of the fanservice which was almost a parody of itself. The comedy of the show is genuinely funny in some aspects and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes they had. Overall this shows is just something you watch to relax to or to sing along to the VERY catchy OP and ED. \n\r\n                                                            overall enjoyment: 8",

I think this mangaka didn't deserve to be treated so unfairly, but the manga getting cancelled was probably for the better, considering it took a crash-and-burn turn to the road to cringeville. I am disappointed as a fan of the anime that this manga having potential as a wonderfully absurd fanservice shanked itself by squandering its one strength: novelty.",
    "al attempt to give them motive for their participation in Keijo.\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ll give some kudos to Keijo for knowing not to take its premise too seriously and relishing in it, it is still a fan service title that doesn\u2019t have much going for it in terms of depth beyond over-the-top sports action with boob and butt attacks coming from its mostly attractive female cast. Fan service anime fans are likely to give this a watch. But if you\u2019re looking for any deeper depth to your anime, then I\u2019d avoid watching Keijo.",
    " it will be hype. There is a manga where a girl turns into a spider but because they use the shonen formula it is not wierd at all.\n\r\nIt also has a concept where\n                  \n\nit makes you go \"I have to see this\" making it very easy to get into like some other anime.\n\r\nI found myself hyped up at their abilities and battles and that made it even funnier for me. \n\r\nI am a simple man if I enjoy something I give it a good score. 8/10 (maybe I will re-watch it one day and it will become a 9/10 but not yet)",

Not like some other Animes, with random Pantie shots etc.... Keijo is played on the \"land\" around Water. The Story is more likely based on the fact they all nearly wear nothing ^^ And still it manages to find a balance, between the WTF moments and the Humourous, Funny lovely Moments. So YEa overall it was a good show. 7 Points here.",

    "rtunately the short length was due to the manga artist being forced to cancel the manga which is too bad ofc even so the anime didn't cover up the remaining chapters. It's one of those anime where if you wanna see more of the story you would have to go to its original material to see for yourself. As for recommendations I actually don't have a particular title in mind but if you love sports and tons of boobs and booty thrown at ya then this is DEFINITELY the perfect series.\n\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

Maybe done on purpose but who knows.\n\r\nOverall Keijo is honestly worth watching. 12 episodes only won't take your whole day and you may find it funny and enjoyable.",

Keijo just doesn\u2019t do enough. It starts off well, but can\u2019t follow through.\n\r\nKeijo doesn\u2019t really end, either, and it\u2019s not getting a second season. It\u2019s pretty abrupt.",

Obviously, the original author is a man of culture and I think the anime adaptation does a pretty good job of getting those cultured ideas across xD",
    " it makes me laugh so much \ud83d\ude02. The special techniques they have are so funny. If you like wtf Japan humor, you will like this.\n\r\nFinal tough: I think this is for people who had watched several anime in their lives and are already accustomed to weird Japan things.  They achieved to make something that will make you laugh and be overhyped by girls jumping in a pool.\n\r\nTy for reading :), I'm late to rate this anime but I really wanted to do it.\n\r\nPS: Sorry if this looks weird, english is not my native language.",
    "The whole thing gets more and more nuts until it\u2019s a shonen battle anime with explosions, auras, and over the top signature attacks. \n\r\nOne thing I am very grateful for is they is no\n                  \n\nreal focus on the girls\u2019 looks from a male perspective. That would\u2019ve made things really creepy. The gals comment on and complement each other but it\u2019s all good sportsmanship and sisterhood of the team and competition. There\u2019s are some yuri sex pest jokes, but that\u2019s not unexpected.  \n\r\nIt\u2019s a wild ride.  <3"
